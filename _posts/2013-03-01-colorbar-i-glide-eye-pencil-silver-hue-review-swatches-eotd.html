<strong>My views on the I-glide pencil-Silver hue:</strong>

Colorbar I-glides are pencil eye liners which give the effect of a liquid eyeliner. This pencil glides effortlessly and its smooth formulation gives your eyes rich colour in a single stroke. It even blends in easily just after application. Once set, it lasts longer than 8 hours without the issue of feather or bleed.

The <strong><em>shade ‘Silver Hue’</em></strong> is a very bright silvery white colored eye liner. It leaves an intense metallic color with a single stroke on the eyelids. The color shouts total festive and would grab high attention quite easily ;).

I prefer using this in a smudged manner than in full effect. Better prep you eyes first using a good concealer and compact (hide the imperfections) and then apply this liner lightly and smudge it instantly finishing off with loads of mascara and you would definitely rock this shade.

It stays on till you remove it using a proper remover at the end of the day. Even rubbing your eyes accidently or splashing water would not make this liner budge from its place. It scores full points in this area.

The pencil can be easily sharpened which you need to do often as it is too soft and gets used up pretty quickly. The pencil comes in the same color as that of the shade (silver here) so identifying it is quite easy. The top plastic cap is sturdy and keeps the soft kohl inside safe.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Intense pigmentation</li>
	<li>Very soft and smooth in application</li>
	<li>Can be sharpened.</li>
	<li>Can be used as a liner or to highlight the brow bone/inner eye corners too.</li>
	<li>Stays on forever.</li>
	<li>Does not budge or smudge</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The shade being highly metallic may accentuate the dark eye circles/lid pigmentation so better use a concealer first.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Ratings:</strong> 4.5/5

<strong>Final verdict:</strong> A truly festive color to go well with your ethnic wear. Try the smudged/toned down look for far better results. Shows admirable results when used as a inner eye/brow bone highlight too. Highly recommended.
