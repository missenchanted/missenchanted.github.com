If you get a blush for £2, you are bound to get excited specially when you want to try some shades and experiment with them. I recently picked this up in my latest <em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/my-mua-haul/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUA Haul</span></a>.</span></em> I was just too excited to see the price tag and wanted to pick up all the shades, but I restrained my self from doing that and picked up just one shade for trial... So am I going to get the other shades...??

<strong> Price: </strong>£2

Me not a fan of this packaging, its very cheap and easily breakable. Though the color looks very pretty and quite bold in the pan, but its a very sheer shade and gives a very healthy sheen to the cheeks without any color. With foundation this sheen lasts me 2-3 hours only and almost fades away. But the best part is it works great base for powdered blushes and MUA has a matching powder blush for each cream blush.

So the question was am I going to pick this range again. I think I might pick up all the shades. I won't say its a great blush obviously, but definitely worth the price and good option to try out different shades for yourself, without breaking the bank.
<p style="text-align: center;">For this I had to swipe like 5-6 times... so that camera can show up some color</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Blended with fingers</p>
