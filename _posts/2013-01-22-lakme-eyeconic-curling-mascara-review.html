<h4>Lakme eyeconic curling mascara review</h4>
Yesterday the blog was down due to technical reasons, and my sole technical supporter(<em>my younger bro</em>) was enjoying some island in the Arctic Ocean but he is such a sweetheart that he took out time to clean up my mess. So I had some time for myself at night and I planned to watch Zee Awards(<em>not much fan of awards though</em>). It left me pretty confused with so many categories for the same award...Jury...Popular...Critics....International, as though they had to give awards to each and every person attending the function.

Coming to the most talked about Lakme release last year... The Lakme Eyeconic range. I had picked up the duo Kajal and Mascara quite sometime back and loved each of them.

One thing that you would notice is the packaging of the Lakme eyeconic mascara, its not a traditional round tube, but with a slight twist. The brush is curved and claims to give curled lashes.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakme-eyeconic-curling-mascara-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5760" title="Lakme eyeconic curling mascara 3" alt="Lakme eyeconic curling mascara review" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakme-eyeconic-curling-mascara-3.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
I have been using this mascara pretty much everyday and quite happy with it. Firstly it gives very defined lashes and does not clump at all. Does not smudge and lasts me whole day. You have to carefully remove this at the end of the day and I prefer cotton soaked in olive oil, not only does it remove the mascara but also nourishes the eye area.

The only thing that did bothers me a lot is the drying time, it just takes ages(3-4 minutes) to dry which is more than sufficient to spoil the makeup.

I tried it using the way mentioned at the back of carton, to get curled lashes, but it turned out rather bad. So I use it my way, as a defining mascara.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakme-eyeconic-curling-mascara-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5761" title="Lakme eyeconic curling mascara 4" alt="Lakme eyeconic curling mascara review" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakme-eyeconic-curling-mascara-4.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
This one is surely a hit on the Lakme list considering the price tag, but only if they could improve the drying time. I am definitely going to pick up another tube for sure.
