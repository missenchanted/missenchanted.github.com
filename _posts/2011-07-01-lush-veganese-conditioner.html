My first LUSH purchase included this conditioner. Neither I am a vegan nor did I any such thought while purchasing this product. My only requirement was a conditioner that does not weigh down my hair, and SA suggested me this.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 400 for 100gm<!--more-->

<strong>Shelf life: </strong>14 months

<strong>Product boasts of :</strong> Lavender and lemon all-round conditioner for all hair types. Our vegan customers have quite enough to put up with without having rough, dull, tangled hair. The majority of Lush products are vegan, but making a vegan conditioner without lanolin (from sheared sheep's wool) took us a few years. Absolutely refusing to be beaten, Helen Ambrosen finally found a formula that reached her high standards, using agar seaweed gel as a hair softener with lavender and lemons for shine. It's an effective conditioner for you to use. Vegans and everyone with fine hair should choose this one and stick with it.

<strong>What I like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Does not weigh down my limp hair at all</li>
	<li>Love the fragrance.. its like lemon with some spice :)</li>
	<li>You can feel hair smoothness under running water</li>
	<li>Unlike other conditioners it can be used on scalp, giving volume to limp hair</li>
	<li>Great fr people suffering with dandruff issues</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Generous amount required for shoulder length hair, my 100gm bottle lasted 13-15 washes</li>
	<li>Not that effective on dry ends</li>
	<li>Pretty expensive :(</li>
</ol>

Will not be buying it for sometime as its quite expensive, but if I don't find  a better replacement I might come back :)
