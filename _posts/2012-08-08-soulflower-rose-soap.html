<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you dreamt about soaking in cream and rose, I bet you have. Damn these commercials and all those royal movies where the princess takes a bath with rose petals in total luxury. For commoners like us its the Soulflower Rose soap. It power packed with the smell of Gulkand to be more precise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gulkand is a sweet preserve of rose petals and smells diabetically sweet. Incase you have ever tried the sweet Indian Paan, bang on its the exact same smell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_6948.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4259" title="IMG_6948" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_6948.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 200</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Claims:</strong> This all natural rose soap is very soothing for the nerves &amp; an anti-depressant. It can calm anger &amp; alleviate hangovers. Rose helps improve the skin's appearance &amp; to perfume skin. Stimulating &amp; cleansing this soap is a good choice for dry, mature, rough or irritated skins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contains:</strong> Rosehip essential oil, crushed rose petals, Vitamin E, glycerin, aqua, saponified oils of olive, coconut ,palm &amp; palm kernel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My experience:</strong> This is the first soulflower soap which fills up my washroom with aroma, and its lingers for like 8-9 hours, but the aroma is not transfered on skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its a beautiful red colors soap with a very very sweet rose aroma. It lathers well and does not melt like crazy when left in the washroom unattended. It did feel a bit drying to me, but again I have very dry skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This one is a party for Rose lovers, to be more specific Gulkand lovers, I find it a bit too much for my nose.</p>
