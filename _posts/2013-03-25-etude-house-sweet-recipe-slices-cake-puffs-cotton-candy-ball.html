<h4>Etude House Sweet recipe slices cake puffs &amp; Cotton candy ball</h4>
I might fall short of words if I start appreciating the hard work and creativity that goes into Etude House Products. I can just keep them on my desk and adore them for hours... but then it wont serve the purpose. With a strong heart I have to unpack them and use too, so that I can review them.

<em>Etude House Sweet recipe slices cake puff</em>s is an adorable set of 8 makeup sponges, packed in the shape of a cake. The quality of the sponge is great and works beautifully with the foundation.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.120 approx (<em>2500 South Korean Won</em>)

The Round end is good for larger areas like cheek and forehead, whereas the pointed tip is good for smaller areas around eyes and nose

<strong>Etude House Sweet recipe Cotton candy ball</strong>

This is just so simple idea for packaging but does wonders when we see this on the shop shelf ?
<strong>Price.</strong> Rs.100 approx (2000 South Korean Won)

These are not exactly cotton balls but cotton sheets(15cm long) rolled up to a ball.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7900" alt="Etude House Cotton candy ball" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Etude-House-Cotton-candy-ball-6.jpg" width="900" height="600" /><!--more-->You can create your self this, with a container similar to this(easily available), decorate it with some cute pink and purple stickers, maybe a few artificial flowers. Roll up your cotton in small balls and its done.

Will let the pictures speak for themselves now..................
