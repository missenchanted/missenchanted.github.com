<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer is already here, and those prickly heat powders, glucose drinks and my yummy Rasna ads are flocking the TV. I am currently using the Soulflower Charcoal You Smell Good Soap and I am quite happy about it, and can easily say its a perfect match for the skin in summers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 250</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_6588.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3428" title="IMG_6588" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_6588.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About soap:</strong> Lather up with this bar of soap &amp;let active bamboo charcoal go deep to draw out body smells, remove blockages that breed bumps, breakouts &amp;acne. Deodorize &amp; dissolve dull, dry skin &amp;surface impurities. If you suffer from dry skin, use charcoal soap to replace harsher cleansers. For adults with mild acne, a charcoal cleanser can help prevent outbreaks. The blend of antibacterial &amp; deodorant essential oils prevent body odor from its very root-toxins &amp;bacteria! Use in the morning to control body odor throughout the day, in armpits, under thighs &amp;all over your body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contains: </strong>Essential oils of teatree, benzoin, peppermint &amp; rosemary, turnip juice, activated charcoal powder, Vitamin E, glycerin, aqua, saponified oils of olive, coconut, castor, palm &amp; palm kernel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> The soap is in two colors, the black one has scrubbing features and charcoal looks, the white one is more soothing and smells like peppermint. It has minute black scrubbing particles which I sometimes fined very harsh and sometimes very mild, maybe it has to do with the way they are packed in the soap. The peppermint smell wakes up my senses and scrubbing makes my skin feel good. The best part about the soap is that it leaves you feeling fresh and squeaky clean without drying. I am not much sure about theÂ deodorizing effect, its hard as I stay in Bangalore.. where you rarely ever sweat.</p>
<em><strong>Unlike my other soaps I did not cut this into pieces as the two parts work together to make a good soap</strong></em>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Smell, it instantly makes me feel fresh,</li>
	<li>Like the scrubbing effect, be careful sometimes it can be a bit harsh,</li>
	<li>Does not dry the skin,</li>
	<li>Easily available, look out for Fashionandyou Soulflower sales for bottom prices,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The scrubbing particles are not uniformly distributed,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I totally likes this soap after a couple of flop soaps. Would totally recommend this specially for Summers for its smell and scrubbing action.</p>
