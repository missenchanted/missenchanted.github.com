<p style="text-align: justify;">Monday is going smooth, since I know tomorrow is a holiday.. and I decide to finish the book about Netaji tomorrow. Weekends come and go and my plans to pamper my hair just get postpones every time, since I am too lazy to do anything. Not that I have beautiful locks, in fact you can assume just the opposite of it. So whenever I see some quick fix for my hair, I just need to pick them up and thus I picked up the Oriflame Hair Mask just for the sole reason it has coconut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a coconut freak... I hoard coconut sweets, <em>piña colada</em> yum yum...</p>

<strong>My Experience:</strong> The thing that stands out the most is the yummy coconut smell, which I absolutely adore... a big thumbs up for that. But as a mask its not a magic product, it a regular hair mask which does its work quietly, while I enjoy the coconut :P

This cannot be used as conditioner,  as its not a 2 minute mask. I use it over my washed hair and leave it for 15 minutes and then just rinse off completely. Leaved my hair soft and does not weigh them down.

I had been using the Dove hair mask before this and was quite pleased with it.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I would recommend this product only to those who love coconut smell, else its just the regular hair mask.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just one wish not only for <em>Oriflame</em> but for everyone(<em>Dove, Loreal etc etc</em>) ... provide us with a pump packing... a tub packaging is seriously not good when you have to dig in and it leaves behind certain drops of water...<em>pretty please :cute face:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Happy Gandhi Jayanti to everyone!!!</strong></em></p>
