<p style="text-align: justify;">Dreamy Charcoal... even better Steamy charcoal. I love woody charcoal smell, so much that I love having it in my food too. Tell me who does'nt love the smell of Smoked potatoes, or country side food... I do and I am nuts about them. I tried out my first first few charcoal based products in <em><a href="http://missenchanted.com/soulflower-charcoal-you-smell-good-soap/" target="_blank">Soulflower Charcoal You Smell Good </a></em>and <em><a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-dark-angels-cleanser/" target="_blank">LUSH Dark Angels</a></em> and I love them to bits.</p>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 690 for 100gm
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>LUSH Dark Angels</em> is my weekly scrub since its kind of harsh for daily use, but then I met his gentle cousin The Coal face,  I find it very interesting and its shiny texture kind of remind me of the space material from Spider man 3.. seriously its almost stone like.</p>

This is my everyday cleanser and I use it like 3-4 times a day. Best ever soap from LUSH...

It works great for my oily skin, removes shine and oil for a long time and rescues breakout size slightly. My skin feels squeaky clean and supple. This does not dry me out. Unlike LUSH Dark Angels this one lathers really well, and wait for the best part.... It does not melt in your washroom ..and removes makeup.. hurray to that !!!!

But 100gm will outlast its shelf life of 3 months, even if you use it twice a day, so give half of it to your best friend.

Would totally recommend this LUSH gem to all oily skin beauties without second thoughts. This one is my buddy for life.
