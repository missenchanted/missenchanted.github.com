<p style="text-align: justify;">I got this purple beauty from <a href="http://beautyandthecheap.blogspot.in" target="_blank">Nisha</a>, and for a purple crazy like me this was a perfect gift ... Thanks dear :).. Something purple.. something lavender.. has to be the perfect cocktail ever..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7145-e1349246987649.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4655" title="IMG_7145" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7145-e1349246987649.jpg" width="403" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.195 for 250ml</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Claim:</strong> The healing properties of tea tree oil are well known. For centuries it has been utilised for its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, giving unhappy skin a new lease of life. But lavender packs a few healthy punches too and this bath foam uses it to maximum effect. Not just a pretty face (and smell), Lavender has the power to aid sleep and relaxation, cure headaches and even heal your skin. It was very popular with the ancient Greeks, who treated and burned it to release its relaxing powers, although they used to call it Nard. So treat yourself to a tea tree and lavender bath (or 'nard bath' if you prefer) and let the purple stuff do you some good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My experience:</strong> This Shower gel is indeed pretty.. why?? .. because its purple na. I have this biased love for everything purple, but I shall not get carried away with it.. promise.
I did not find anything amazing at all with this shower gel, the fragrance is good, but nothing heavenly. The fragrance doesn't linger onto your skin or the washroom after the bath.. that's bad. Neither its very calming or relaxing at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall its just a plain simple shower gel which looks pretty and comes in a sturdy packaging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had heard such good words about Original Source products online, but the first product turned out very plain and simple. I am not going to buy this particular product again, and would neither suggest this to anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Are you also purple crazy ??</strong></em></p>
