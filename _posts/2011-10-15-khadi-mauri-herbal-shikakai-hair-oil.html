I have been nourishing my locks with parachute coconut oil since childhood, although I had tried Vatika once long time back. I have experimented with hair spa creams but never with oil.... maybe because there were not much options. Khadi name itself makes you believe that the product is going to be safe and herbal :) .. Its just a thought and not a proof.. please pardon me :P

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_1341.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1389" title="IMG_1341" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_1341.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="500" /></a>

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_1341.jpg"></a>Price : Rs.64 for 210ml... thats dirt cheap

Contains:<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_1342.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1390" title="IMG_1342" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_1342.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>Pros:
<ol>
	<li>Smooths frizzy hair</li>
	<li>It definitely reduced my hair fall a lot.. its almost gone.. not sure if I should attribute totally to this</li>
</ol>
Cons:
<ol>
	<li>Availability is an issue</li>
	<li>Packaging is quite flimsy, but I cant expect much at that price,</li>
</ol>
Although it claims to remove Dandruff and hair fall, cant't say anything about dandruff but yes it did stop my hair fall like 90%. I have already ordered my second bottle and will surely give my final verdict after finishing that :)

Have you ever tried any Khadi hair product ?
