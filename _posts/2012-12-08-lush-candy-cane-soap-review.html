<p style="text-align: justify;">Its christmas already, and I will be traveling home for a good whole 10 days. A wedding to attend and some outing with friends and family, Cant wait for the next week to start. Mostly my posts will be scheduled for a few days, but will try to be in touch hopefully if the Internet works...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lets start our Christmas celebrations with the LUSH goodies this season, LUSH Candy Cane soap</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" title="LUSH candy Cane" alt="" src="http://static.missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2782.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a limited edition LUSH soap themed around Christmas holidays. The complete soap is in shape of a Candy bar and smells like a mint Candy but looks like a bubblegum candy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its pale baby pink but if you are lucky, you might get some red pieces with it, but I wasnt so lucky I suppose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its an average LUSH soap, which cleanses well. According to me it should be bought just to celebrate the spirit of holiday, beacuse if I start comparing it with other LUSH contemporaries this one will left far behind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It isn't moisturizing.. which is my biggest need at this time of the year. Its does not lather much, and I start missing my regular shower gels then. Shouldn't Christmas be all about bubbles, candies, and yup moisturizing too ? but I wont stop you, this one is totally to celebrate the spirit of christmas, so I wont stand between you guys...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Happy Weekend everyone!!! What plans ?</strong></em></p>
