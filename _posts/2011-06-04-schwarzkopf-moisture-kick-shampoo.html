Was advised this by a stylist at Lakme studio, Bangalore. I had been using  T.G.I. CATWALK Elevating shampoo for some time and it had made my hair ends dry. I have a oily scalp and dry hair, I have tough time selecting hair products and haven't found the best combination for me yet.

<ol>
	<li>Nice packaging, similar to all T.G.I. products</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I hate about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Not that moisturizing for me, did nothing for my ends :(</li>
</ol>
I had my hair colored 6 months back, and had been using a volume shampoo from T.G.I. but all I was left was with rough and dry ends. I had high hopes from this shampoo, but it served very low:( I wont be buying it again.

<strong>People with normal hair can give it a try, for seriously damaged hair I would say No.</strong>

<strong>What shampoo you use ?</strong>
