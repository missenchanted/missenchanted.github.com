Hair speak a volume about you... mine lack volume... hmm they are sort of dumb. I recently cut my hair very short and colored them, since long hair look flat and dull on me. I have stuck with TBS Banana Conditioner for so long, and would continue to do so, but recently in some sale the SA suggested to pick 2 products and get 15% off and asked me to try the Voulme conditioner.... worst decision ever.. so <em>Moral of the story is Sale par mat jao..apni akal lagao</em>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 515 for 250ml

<strong>Claims:</strong> A light conditioner, with stimulating guarana berry extract, to help create fuller hair with added body.

<strong>My experience:</strong> It has got nothing to give related to volume for like miles...and also as a conditioner its not very moisturizing.

Very mild sweet smell, and the texture is very runny, unlike other conditioners.

Only plus point being its not very heavy, it will not weigh down your hair.

Neither will I pick it up again, and nor I would suggest this to anyone. For me investing Rs.500 in a conditioner like that is just too much.. I am a big fan of TBS Banana Conditioner and will stick to it for a long time.

W<em><strong>hich is your favorite Voluminizing conditioner ??</strong></em>
