<strong>Maybelline Baby Lips Berry Crush Review &amp; Swatch</strong>

There are already two of the  Maybelline Baby Lips reviewed (<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><a href="http://missenchanted.com/maybelline-baby-lips-lipbalm-coral-flush/" target="_blank">Coral Flush</a></em></span> &amp; <em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/maybelline-baby-lips-in-anti-oxidant-berry/" target="_blank">Anti Oxidant Berry</a></span></em>). I am adding the Maybelline Baby Lips Berry Crush. This is a little tinted version in the same range of Maybelline Baby Lips. Soon I hope there will be a post that sums up all the Baby Lips tubes like the one that is available for <em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/soap-review-digest-14-soulflower-soaps/" target="_blank">Soulflower soaps</a></span></em>.

I love the light tinted ones since they provide a nice pop of color along with the moisturizing for my lips.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.150

The packaging is same as the predecessors, the twist up circular tube with a tinted product slowly sliding out with every twist. The texture is smooth and thin and glides very cleanly on my lips without leaving behind any clumps. The lip balm does not feel waxy on my lips. It provides good moisturizing feel to my lips. Well, not all day as the brand claims, I need reapplication in between (<em>at least 2 more times</em>).  This replaces my lipstick easily when I am in real hurry.

The tint of dim pink this lip balm provides is very beautiful and serves my desire of naturally flushing healthy happy lips. Along with the tint it also provides very good hydration to my lips.

But I must say, <em>the pervious range of lip balms from Maybelline were good too and behaved similarly</em>. I feel it is just to be in the lime light and grab some attention.

Maybelline launched this new range with a different packing system and a different pricing system. Else, everything looks more or less same to me. <em><strong>What do you say??</strong></em>

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Twist up tube.</li>
	<li>Travel friendly product.</li>
	<li>Thin texture with no waxy feel.</li>
	<li>Moisturizes the dry lips very well.</li>
	<li>A light tint of pink is present in the Berry Crush.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I dislike:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Not really a next generation product with any major difference or product enhancement.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Recommendation:</strong>  Yes. They are very good; no doubt in that aspect.

<strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5
