<p style="text-align: justify;">I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.stylecraze.com" target="_blank">stylecraze.com</a> when searching madly for some Colorbar products online, and was completely bowled over by the range of Nail colors they stock (Pardon me for my color craziness).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stylecraze.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1790" title="stylecraze" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stylecraze.png" alt="" width="1024" height="819" /></a><strong>About Stylecraze.com:</strong> Style Craze is started by Chetana, an Amateur Make up artist from Hyderabad. According to her no makeup lover should miss out due to lack of variety in retail stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Delivery and Packaging : </strong>I placed my order on 20th and it reached me on 23rd. After placing the order, got a confirmation call next day and the order was confirmed. Parcel was sent using Aramex courier as it was Cash on delievry.The package came in a cardbox securely taped from all sides and every individual item was bubble wrapped. Shipping is free for orders above Rs. 250, else one has to shell out Rs. 35, and they have a 7 day return policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_2366.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1797" title="IMG_2366" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_2366.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><strong>Shopping experience: </strong>Their website is quite organised and vibrant(Orangy), I believe they are still in a growth phase in terms of the number of brands they stock. But as all of us know its the quality that matters and not quantity, with brands such as Orly, Nyx, Sally hansen I definitely look forward to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_2367.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1796" title="IMG_2367" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_2367.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a><strong>What I Ordered:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Orly Miniature Nail Lacquer(Wandering Vine ) - No chance I was going to miss it :)</li>
	<li>NYX Nail Art(Silver Glitter )</li>
	<li>Vega Pedicure File - Dual &amp; Vega Large Emery Foot File</li>
	<li>Jovees Kajal</li>
	<li>Neutrogena Norwegian Formula E18Lip Moisturizer</li>
	<li>Lakme Eye Colour Quartet Shadow-Desert rose</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Freebie: </strong>The Lakme nail polish shade that I ordered was out of stock, but they sent me an almost 99% same shade in Lakme and that too as a freebie... :D</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_23691.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1799" title="IMG_2369" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_23691.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a><strong>What I like about them</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>They have a huge collection of international brands Orly, NYX and OPI.</li>
	<li>They stock Konad stuff, which is not that common in India,</li>
	<li>They have discount on every product :) - Thumbs up</li>
	<li>Customer care is very promptive, if the product is not in stock it is reported immediately.(My experience for same has been really bad with FnU)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I would love to see</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>I wish they stock some brands like Khadi, E.L.F. which are just impossible to reach us,</li>
	<li>Unlike other website if they can give a link to newly added products, that would be really helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like</strong>
Hmmm, none as such,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Will I purchase again:</strong> Yes definitely, I will specially go back again for nail paints.</p>
