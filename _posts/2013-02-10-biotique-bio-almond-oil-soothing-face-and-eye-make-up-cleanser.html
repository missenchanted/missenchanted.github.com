<strong>What I feel about the Product: </strong>

Biotique Bio Almond Oil Soothing Face and Eye Make Up Cleanser is my first ever Biotique purchase when I was looking out for a nice makeup remover for myself. The name itself and the price are enough for you to get this.

Biotique cleanser is a light yellow colored liquid with an oil kind of consistency.  It has a distinct rather mild sweet smell. Being completely herbal and a mixture of various oils, it tends to be quite greasy in texture.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Biotique-Bio-Almond-Oil-Soothing-Face-and-Eye-Make-Up-Cleanser-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6226" title="Biotique Bio Almond Oil Soothing Face and Eye Make Up Cleanser 4" alt="Biotique Bio Almond Oil Soothing Face and Eye Make Up Cleanser" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Biotique-Bio-Almond-Oil-Soothing-Face-and-Eye-Make-Up-Cleanser-4.jpg" width="900" height="523" /></a></p>
I take few drops of the oil and massage it directly to my face and within seconds, it removes all the makeup from my eyes and face without any stinging sensation. But it does leave a greasy feel and I then use my normal face wash to wash off the excess of this oil. Preferable way is to use it on a cotton ball and then swipe it on to your eyes and face to effectively remove the makeup without leaving an oily film behind.

Just a little massage or 2-3 swipes of this oil removes all the makeup nicely, even the stubborn waterproof types. On top of that, the richness of almond oil gives a nice soothing feel to the skin. I do not apply my night cream when I use this makeup cleanser during nights as it leaves the skin feeling silky-fresh.

It has not caused any breakouts nor have I felt any kind of irritation after using this one. Only point of concern here is the greasy film which it leaves behind, that may not suit oily skin types.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Effective cleanser for removing makeup easily</li>
	<li>Removes the waterproof makeup too.</li>
	<li>Cheap</li>
	<li>Completely herbal</li>
	<li>Does not cause any skin irritation or breakouts.</li>
	<li>This can act as a good night cream too.</li>
	<li>Plastic packaging with the small nozzle discharge and a tight screw cap makes an efficient packaging.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The cleanser has a greasy texture which leaves a heavy feel post application.</li>
	<li>May not suit combination to oily skin types.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Ratings: </strong>4.35/5

<strong>Final Word</strong>: An effective herbal makeup remover for the normal to dry skinned beauties. It acts as a cleanser and nourishes the skin too. You may find a need to wash off the excess oil later using your face wash.
