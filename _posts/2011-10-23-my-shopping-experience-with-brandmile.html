Way we shop has been revolutionized with the entry of <a href="http://Divya58060.fashionandyou.com">Fashionandyou.com</a>,<a href="http://www.99labels.com/v1/Visa-Member.aspx?re=divya.yadav1@gmail.com"> 99labels.com</a>, <a href="http://www.brandmile.com/invite/divyay">brandmile.com</a> and since then there has been a flood of trustworthy and quality website. I always prefer online shopping over street shopping.

I feel its high time I share my experinece :)

What I loved:
<ol>
	<li>Good customer service, my last order was COD. Since I was out of India and unreachable of phone, the courier was returned back. But they shipped it back to me without any extra cost,</li>
	<li>They sometimes sport brands like soulflower etc, which are not that readily available.</li>
	<li>Quality of stuff is good,</li>
	<li>Additional 5% discount, if payment is made at the time of checkout,</li>
	<li>Cash on delivery option available</li>
</ol>
What I did not like:
<ol>
	<li>It my opinion that sales are not that drooling of compared with <a href="http://Divya58060.fashionandyou.com">Fashionandyou.com</a>,</li>
	<li>Price is a bit on higher side, when compared to other sites,</li>
	<li>An extra shipping fee, if Cash on delivery option is selected :(</li>
</ol>
I will definately shop with them again, sometimes they come out with good bargains and during festive seasons they have free shipping :)
