<p style="text-align: justify;">I love to keep things loaded with peppermint in my bag, specially when summer is here. I have oily and acne prone skin and I mostly stick to my favorite face-washes Clean n Clear &amp; Nivea Visage Oil Control. But I love this cleanser a bit more for its refreshing touch and clove/peppermint aroma.</p>

Moisten the skin then take one-teaspoon of Mint Cleanser with a little water and massage it on the face and neck in upward and outward movements for a few minutes. Remove it with a damp cotton pad and then rinse your face with a splash of water. The cleanser has to be removed thoroughly without leaving any residue. Use morning and night for best results. It contains plant extracts and pure essential oils of peppermint, spearmint, clove, pineapple, sunflower, neem, garlic, juniper, rose, ylang ylang and rosemary.

<strong>My Experience:</strong> I like the aroma of the cleanser, its a very powerful smell of clove and peppermint, helps me opening my eyes and senses in the morning. The texture is very light and fluffy and feels like shaving cream :P

To use I massage it on my damp face, and then remove it with a muslin cloth in circular movements. But be careful when using this on the eyes as it burned, but slowly now I am used to it. People with sensitive skin please do not use this on the eyes. It removes all makeup and dirt in one application, and leaves me oil free for 4-5 hours.

What I don't like with AM products is their packaging, although they have revamped their looks, but tub packaging for a cleanser is a big no no for me.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I love the aroma, its very refreshing and lifts up my spirits in the morning,</li>
	<li>Removes dirt, oil and makeup in one application,</li>
	<li>Keeps the skin oil free for 4-5 hours,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I do not like:</strong>

Will definitely suggest this for oily skin and also if you are looking out for something more safe and fresh feel for the skin. I am going to repurchase this again for sure.
