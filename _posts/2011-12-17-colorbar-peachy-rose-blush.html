I had been on a lookout for a peachy blush, since long and after reading a lot about Colorbar Peachy Rose I knew I wanted this... but it took me a long time to get my hands on this. Colorbar counter is removed from almost every place I know and one day I hit it at Bangalore Central,

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.300, its available at discount online

<strong>Colorbar says: </strong>Available in five shades, Plum Brown, Cosmic Rose, Fuchsia, Peachy Rose and Just Earth, the Blusher accentuates the cheek area giving a glow to the face. This talc free, silky powder contains a moisture balance formula that is easy to blend and keeps the skin smooth, hydrated and nourished for soft cheeks with just the right hint of color.

This is such a beautiful peachy shade with pink undertones and subtle glitter,

<strong>What I love about it:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>It is such a beautiful shade  :All-I-See-is-Love:</li>
	<li>Mirror in it comes in handy so many times,</li>
	<li>Very soft and easy to blend,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Brush is a total turn off, it sheds likes crazy..... literally crazy,</li>
	<li>I wish it could last a bit longer, but it fades too soon,</li>
	<li>Colorbar has increased the price from Rs.250 to Rs.300.... not liking it :(</li>
</ol>
Would love to buy this shade again and again. I read on Mehak's blog that she uses this over a cream blush to make it last longer.
