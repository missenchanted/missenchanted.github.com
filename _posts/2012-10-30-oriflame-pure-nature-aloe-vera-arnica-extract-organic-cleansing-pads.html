<p style="text-align: justify;">Summers might be long gone, but the dust on the roads and partially humidity still makes me go back to my purse for that sheet of cleanser. I picked this product just for the sole reason that I can carry them in my bag without any fuss. I had been using the Kara one's earlier but I definitely prefer the tub packaging anytime.</p>

This product has it cons and pros, but I liked it for this definately served my purpose.

As a <em>makeup remover</em> this one is not a champion, but effective for light compact, gloss and slight eye makeup.

<em>Does it remove Dirt and grime ??</em>, yup it does, but since I have oily skin, I definately have to wash my face after this.Â These pads are small in size, so one mind end up using 2-3 at a time.

Another <strong><em>great way</em></strong> is to keep this in refrigerator and use as eye pads to cool off your eye, while dozzing off. Believe me you would love it.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I would recommend these if you want something hygenic to remove that dirt and oil during travel and something thats neat and hygenic and does not create a fuss in you purse. But would not recommend this if you think it can be an alternative for makeup remover.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Ok off to my dozzing session with Oriflame Aloe Vera pads Chao!!!!</strong></em></p>
