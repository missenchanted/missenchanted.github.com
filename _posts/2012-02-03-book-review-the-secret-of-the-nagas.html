The most apt Sequel to <a href="http://missenchanted.com/review-the-immortals-of-meluha/">The Immortals of Meluah....</a>

It's a rare phenomenon in Indian reads that sequel justifies or reaches out to be better than the predecessor, but Amish has delivered a great Novel. He has sketched such characters in the book, that I am in love with Shiva and just can't wait for his finale book.

When I started with the book, it did not impress me much, also I found the style so much different that book1, but from Chapter 4 I was on a roller coaster, could not keep the book down and the end of the ride left me in aw, Now what...!!!! that was my expression. Such an intelligent and well riveted piece of fiction.

A worthy thriller and must read on everyone's list. Well done Amish, you are one of the best story teller(As a writer still a lot to improve) we have today :)
