Weekend was all about finishing designs for the furniture, meeting friends and a freshly baked tray of chocolate brownie's.. oh yeah the India-Pak match...and Sridevi &amp; Madhuri Dixit on Jhalak Dhiklaja. Looking forward for a colorful week.. since 2nd October is a holiday... yaaay

I love watching Jalak Dhiklaja for the most graceful lady of our era.. Madhuri love her smile... love her istile.. <em>Wah Wah!!! </em>and Sridevi's guest appearance was just icing on the cake... <em>Did you watch the episode ?</em>

Ok Coming to one of my favorite products, which I love mostly for its shade alone...

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7155.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4644" title="IMG_7155" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7155.jpg" width="900" height="629" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> INR 650/- for 3.5 gm

<strong>Claims:</strong> More delicious than peaches and cream? We like to think so. Our velvety smooth mineral Rouge Cream Blush offers a sheer wash of radiant color. The glorious payoff is dewy, sultry and long-lasting. Available in 12 shades.

<strong>My Experience:</strong> I just love this shade, it indeed gives the me the most natural flush. There is just nothing wrong about these cream blushes, except the lasting power.

I kind of like NYX blushes both powder and cream, they have good pigmentation, some great shades and cost a dime, if bought in US. The packaging is quite sturdy and transparent cover makes it easy to identify(<em>Although I don't have that many blushes</em>)

I use fingers to dab the blush on my cheeks and pat them to spread properly, this way I get better control rather then using it with a blush.

On my oily cheeks it lasts for 3-4 hours and then fades drastically.

*Avoid these during summers or outdoor trip, it might melt in heat :( , but a total thumbs up for the winter season... for sure.

I am not much of a blush person, but this one particular shade I totally love. It gives a very authentic natural glow. Will definitely recommend these if you are afraid of colors on your cheek, believe me its the best shade for shy girls like us :)

<em><strong>Which is your favorite Blush brand and shade ?</strong></em>
