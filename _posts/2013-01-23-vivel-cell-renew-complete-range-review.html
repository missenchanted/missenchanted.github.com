<p style="text-align: justify;">With so many products being launched around this time of the year, its really hard to follow and get everything, specially for a person like me who like to try everything new. I recently received the complete <em>Vivel Cell Renew</em><em>Fortify + Repair Regimen for gorgeous Skin built Cell by Cell</em> range. Its a set of 3 product for complete skin care needs, I so wish had they launched one lip balm too(<em>Although Vivel does have lip balms but not in this range</em>).. and this range would have been more than complete.</p>
The packaging reminds me of Johnson and Johnson range, and I personally like it. Its plain and simple yet sturdy and functional.

This range claims to repair skin, cell damage and prevents collagen breakdown.

<strong>Vivel Cell Renew Fortify + Repair Hand Crème:</strong>

<strong></strong><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vivel-cell-renew-review-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5778" title="Vivel cell renew review 2" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vivel-cell-renew-review-2.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 99 for 50ml

<strong>What I liked:</strong>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Moisturizes my hands, without making them greasy,</li>
	<li>Moisturizes the cuticle (won't work for super dry or damaged cuticles)</li>
	<li>Does not give sweaty palms,</li>
	<li>Gets absorbed readily,</li>
	<li>I like the smell, it remind me of some old cream from Ponds... or was it Charmis(Not sure...),</li>
	<li>Decent price tag for the quantity,</li>
	<li>Travel friendly, you can easily carry this one in you handbag</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a person like me who works on computer for 14-15 hours, I like my hand creams to be non greasy yet moisturizing and smell good. So I would definately recommend this to everyone, stay away only if you don't like the fragrance.</p>
I myself will purchase this again for sure.

<strong>Vivel Cell Renew Fortify + Repair Body Lotion:</strong>

<strong></strong><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vivel-cell-renew-review-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5780" title="Vivel cell renew review 4" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vivel-cell-renew-review-4.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 249 for 250ml

<strong>What I liked</strong>:
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Pump packaging very hygienic and convenient,</li>
	<li>Non greasy</li>
	<li>Gets absorbed readily,</li>
	<li>Moisturizes well, this will be good for winters as well as summers(Since its not greasy) both</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like</strong>:</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>The smell, I find it a bit medicinal. Though the smell fades away after few minutes of application.</li>
	<li>Lacks protection from sun,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All in all its a good moisturizer, and I would recommend this only to those, whom smell does not matter. I personally don't find myself picking this up, as I love fragrant body lotion and cream.</p>

I received this sample with Current month's Femina.

<strong>What I liked</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>Non greasy</li>
	<li>Gets absorbed readily,</li>
	<li>Even for an oily skin like mine, it gives me a matte finish,</li>

</ol>
<strong>What I did not like</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>No protection from sun,</li>
	<li>Sensitive nose will find the fragrance too stung,</li>
</ol>
<div>Overall its a good cream for skin. Would recommend this to beauties with dry or flakey skin, you would love it.</div>
<em><strong>What do you think about the Vivel Cell Renew Range... are you going to pick up anything ?</strong></em>

<em><strong>*Product was sent by PR, but that has not affected my opinion at all.</strong></em>
