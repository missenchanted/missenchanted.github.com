If you don't know about <a href="http://blisscovered.com/">Blisscovered</a>, then can I ask you one thing... "Where have you been living ?". Ok let me update you on that.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2951.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2841" title="IMG_2951" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2951.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>About Blisscovered:</strong> Its an exclusive club for discovering the best products in luxury beauty

I recently won <strong>Wiseshe+Blisscovered giveaway</strong>, I know I am just too lucky these days. And here I unfold the mystery items in my box (Althougth I already had some hint :P)

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2953.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2843" title="IMG_2953" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2953.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a>So these are the items in my Feburary box

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2955.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2845" title="IMG_2955" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2955.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2954.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2844" title="IMG_2954" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2954.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a>

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2952.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2842" title="IMG_2952" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2952.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>Ok the Verdict is , I really liked the box because,</strong>
<ol>
	<li>It actually contains products, I would have actually bought,</li>
	<li>Some sample sizes are quite decent and enough to make my mind to buy them or not,</li>
	<li>I am totally in love with the box, its so purple and beautiful,</li>
	<li>I have heard about their customer service, its quick and prompt,</li>
</ol>
<strong>Ok now what I did not like,</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Nature's co product are not enough in quantity to come to a decision, I wish they had given only one but in better quantity,</li>
	<li>I would also like if they can ship Delhi/Bangalore and other distant addressed boxes a day earlier than Mumbai, else it takes the mystery and fun out of the box :(</li>
</ol>
Ok the real question, am I going to subscribe again, yup I am... look out for my March box next month :)
