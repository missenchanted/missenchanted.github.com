We all know that every product has a shelf life, and it should not be used beyond that. Its very important that when you buy never ever forget to have a look at that label.

I myself made this mistake but in other sense I was cheated. It was my first visit to LUSH and I ended up buying a solid shampoo, conditioner and soap. I had seen a scratched expiry date, and was told by Representative @ Garuda Mall Bangalore that its still in shelf life.

Rs. 400 into drain. I find myself at mistake here, should have never believed the representative and should have demanded for a new bottle.

I have even written a mail to LUSH INDIA, but got no response. But every thing happens for a purpose I suppose. Don't go by brand or name, check the ingredients and the SHELF LIFE. I am big fan of LUSH, but from next time its my head that makes the choice and not ignorant/cheater representative.

<strong>Has such incidents happened with you ?</strong>

<strong>UPDATE: </strong>I received a letter from LUSH INDIA about the expired product and they have advised me to exchange the product at the same store :)
