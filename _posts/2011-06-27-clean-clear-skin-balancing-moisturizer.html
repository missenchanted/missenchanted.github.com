Had picked this moisturizer for the first time during my college days.. when budget was limited. Have repurchased this product so many times over the years and still continue to use,

<strong>What I like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Totally non greasy</li>
	<li>Gets absorbed very fast and leave the skin soft,</li>
	<li>So light that I use it under makeup,</li>
	<li>Works as great hand cream, greasy creams leave behind an eww feel when working on laptop.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I don't like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>No SPF, so sunscreen needed on top of this,</li>
	<li>I never had breakout during teenage, but now It doesn't help me in stopping breakouts</li>
	<li>Not at all moisturizing for Normal to Dry skin(Leaves behind dry patches for me)</li>
</ol>
I don't use this product on my face, as I have a sensitive combination skin(prone to breakout), but I still use it during summers under makeup and keep it in my bag as a hand cream.
