I have colored hair, got them highlighted a year back, but due to improper care I suppose I developed dry ends, lightened strands and a few silver streaks :(

This time instead of opting for another color I gave LUSH Henna (Caca Marron) a try. I bought this block and shared half of it with my mother as she always complains that other Henna's did not work for her properly.

<strong>My Hair before the application:</strong>

<ol>
	<li>I used 1/6th of the block, grated it for my shoulder length hair,</li>
	<li>Add Hot water, and make a consistent paste</li>
	<li>Apply it covering all hair and for glossy color its advised to cover it wit a wrapping sheet.</li>
	<li>Leave it for a couple of hours and wash it with lukewarm water.</li>
	<li>Although its not mentioned, but I generally don't shampoo after henna, give it a 24 hour gap, for the color to develop</li>
</ol>
<strong>Hair after wash,</strong>

<ol>
	<li>It gave shine to my dull hair</li>
	<li>Easy to prepare and apply, no hassle of adding extra stuff to the henna</li>
	<li>All natural ingredients.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Leaves behind too Oily hair, need to shampoo before going out. (Too Oily :()</li>
	<li>Damn expensive, you have to buy the complete block that's the minimum amount :(</li>
	<li>Did not give full coverage to silver hair, left them Orangy as any other Henna does,</li>
</ol>
<strong>I will not buying this again</strong>... its too expensive and gives the same result as any other Henna. Even my Mom was not quite happy :(

<strong>How do you prepare your Henna ?</strong>
