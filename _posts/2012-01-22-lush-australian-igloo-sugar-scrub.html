<p style="text-align: justify;">I have this hidden desire of going to arctic circle once in my life and admire the Northern lights at least for once</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/valentines-day-aurora-borealis-bo-norway_32398_600x450.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2517" title="valentines-day-aurora-borealis-bo-norway_32398_600x450" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/valentines-day-aurora-borealis-bo-norway_32398_600x450.jpg" width="386" height="580" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok, now coming to the LUSH Australian Igloo, I picked this up last month at 50%... thank god for that. The name itself was enticing enough for me to grab this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 340  for 1 piece</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LUSH says:</strong> A festive wintery scrub to wake up sluggish skin. This little igloo is made with lots of fine sugar, so you can gently scrub your skin. But because it’s winter, we’ve included plenty of other things to perk you up and fight the darkness. There’s bicarb to soften the water and make you feel smooth. We then travel to the other side of the world with Australian sandalwood and eucalyptus, because they both smell fantastic and are great for balancing the skin. Then to soften you up a bit, we’ve hidden a little core of coconut oil inside the sugar, which will leave your skin smooth and moisturised. There’s even dried rosella in here, which helps calm skin and reduce redness. This may be a tough scrub with a look of crisp winter on the outside, but its smooth coconut centre and soft scent with hints of greenery will leave you all warm and snuggly inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Sugar, Sodium Bicarbonate, Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, Cream of Tartar, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Dried Rosella , Siberian Pine Oil , Eucalyptus Blue , Sandalwood Oil, Cocamide DEA, Lauryl Betaine, PEG-6 Caprylic / Capric Glycerides, *Citral, *Coumarin, *Limonene, Methyl Ionone, Perfume, Colour 42090</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My experience: </strong> At first glance  I wasn't sure how to use this, use it as a scrub soap or smash it and make a paste. So I went ahead with the later idea and tried cutting with a knife, but was disappointed. So I gave it a try as a soap, and it was so harsh that it left bruises on my arms. You can imagine the burning sensation I had after that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I liked:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>It smelled like coconut oil, but better,</li>
	<li>It did not leave me a dry and parched skin,</li>
	<li>Surprisingly, this lathered like a mild soap, nothing foaming though,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Its hard for sensitive skin, I had cuts on my arms :(</li>
	<li>Its pricey for the quantity provided,</li>
	<li>Its not a permanent product from LUSH</li>
</ol>
It was more of a compulsive buy, and I wont be picking this up again, I have grounded the entire product and use it a heel scrub and its quite effective for me like that. I wont be picking this up again.
