This was out first abroad trip together, I wanted it to be special and had planned it over a period of 4-5 months. I researched about Malaysia and read travel blogs before coming to the decision of exploring the Eastern Malaysian water as compared to the popular Langkawi and Penag on the western coast. And this is how it all started,

It all happened on one lazy day when I read Airasia offer and did not waste much time in booking a 10 day round trip. Believe me guys airasia offers are a loot, do check them out if you get time. We took flight to Kuala Lumpur and then a connecting fight for <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Terengganu">Kuala Terenggan</a>,</em>

After a long search about the resorts we decided to stay with Redang Kalong Resort who specialize in deep sea diving(Best five certification site in world) and they offer 2 snorkeling trips a day. That gave us an awesome 8 times of beautiful snorkeling trips :). It felt like being in a dream with long stretches of white sand and crystal clear azure water.

There is so much to do for nature lovers from deep sea diving certification to novice sea discovery, kayaking. Since this is a Marina research area water sports are a big no no.

I saw Nemo :) as a couple while snorkeling. Sea is beautiful beyond words, if I say its more colorful than the colors in a rainbow or on a peacock.  Barney would term it as Legend wait for IT dary :). I enjoyed each and every lovely trip to different part of the sea every time.

I can go on and on about the island and about its beauty, but I hope you enjoyed the pic trip. We moved on to Perhentian Islands after 4 days, more about that later :)
