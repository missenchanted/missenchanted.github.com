<h4>The Body Shop Satsuma and Sweet Lemon Soap</h4>
Starting a fresh morning with the most citrusy and fresh feel soaps The Body Shop Satsuma and Sweet Lemon Soap. I have already reviewed my favorite shower gel <a href="http://missenchanted.com/the-body-shop-satsuma-shower-gel/" target="_blank">The Body Shop Satsuma shower gel</a>. I had picked these up quite few days back for they looked really cute and colorful.

Both the soaps no doubt look good and have an attractive packaging. They smell like their counterparts Shower gel which is awesome. Lather nicely and leaves back squeaky clean skin.

When compared to the respective shower gels, these do not leave back any fragrance on the skin as shower gels do.

Even though these contain glycerin yet they are not as moisturizing as the shower gels again.

<strong> Satsuma Soap - </strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-Body-Shop-Satsuma-Lemon-Soap-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6836" title="The Body Shop Satsuma Lemon Soap 5" alt="The Body Shop Satsuma and Sweet Lemon Soap" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-Body-Shop-Satsuma-Lemon-Soap-5.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
Overall for the price tag these are a good purchase. If you don't like shower gels or you want to try something in budget for the citrus range.. no doubt go for these. But if you are looking for a complete package <em>The Body Shop Satsuma and Sweet Lemon Shower Gel</em> has to be that product.
