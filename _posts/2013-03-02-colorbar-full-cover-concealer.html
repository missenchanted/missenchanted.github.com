<h4>Colorbar Full Cover Concealer</h4>
Hi Girls, Of all make up, I think concealer is one of the most difficult things to purchase. If you are blessed with reasonable good skin and need little coverage, it’s a breeze. But if your skin does not have good texture and have dark circles as well as acne blemishes, finding a match can really be a challenge. The range of concealers available in the market including the shades can be confusing. There are various types – liquid concealer, brightening concealers for under eye, stick concealers etc – so much choice but it doesn’t make picking a concealer any easier!

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs 495 for 5g

I have dark under eye circles as well as a spotty face so concealer is important. I also don’t like to look too made up or end up with a cake face. I am pretty price sensitive but after having tried quite a few cheaper concealers, I was willing to pay a higher price for a better coverage concealer. I had MAC Studio Finish concealer in mind but I also read that Colorbar also makes a pretty good concealer.

I was recently at a Colorbar store so decided to try on the Full Cover Concealer. The SA helped me pick the correct shade i.e <em>Sun Beige</em>. I picked the shade mainly with under eye circles in mind. I did try it on my spots but I don’t really put concealer on spots. Foundation does the job pretty ok and I don’t like to conceal too much.

I took a few pics in the store with the concealer on and even though I felt it had a greyish tinge in the artificial lighting, I went ahead and got it as its wasn’t very expensive. The Colorbar Concealer is a full cover concealer and is available in about 8-9 shades. I picked Sun Beige. I think this shade should suit most Indian skins. It was also the most used tester among all others.

It is creamy, blends well and looks natural. But the outcome that you get from a concealer also depends on how you apply it.<em> It’s better not to moisturise before you use concealer as there is a chance that the moisturiser may break down the concealer if they don’t match (water + oil do not go well together)</em>

I was told by the SA to apply and blend with fingers, as the body heat helps the pigment settle into the skin better. I apply it from the inner corners of the eye and extend all the way past corners of the eyes and extend to tops of cheeks if I have any dark spots there. I prefer applying with brush and blending with wet sponge or dabbing with fingers. I set with translucent powder and sometimes use Vega stippling brush to buff away extra powder.

It does not give me a cakey finish.  The SA insisted the concealer is water resistant. I wore it during the day in a non-air conditioned environment. It did not last very long – maybe 3 to 4 hours as I also tend to rub my eyes often.

I found that it fared and looked better in the evenings, maybe as the weather is much cooler.

<strong>Pro</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Tub packaging. For me this is a pro as I like to have better control over how much product I am using</li>
	<li>Thick texture which gives good coverage</li>
	<li>No weird glittery particles</li>
	<li>Water resistant</li>
	<li>Doesn’t transfer</li>
	<li>Good quantity so will last long</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Slight greyish tint in photos</li>
</ul>
I am comfortable with the pricing and results. I will wait to use it a bit more especially during Mumbai summers before I declare it my HG concealer or repurchase it. I think 5g should last me at least a year so will decide then whether I will repurchase.
