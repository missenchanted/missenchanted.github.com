<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing can be better than a tub of warm water for tired legs. We girls are the best subject to leg fatigue, imagine the kind of running we need to do around the mall, across the street and lets not forget the sale madness. My legs almost give up after a complete day of shopping. Back home I just jump into a tub of hot water and my favorite TV program :) Till date I had never used salt crystals for foot, I always preferred Avon and VLCC foot soak solution. But I will take my words back and declare this salt is amazing, far better than anything else I have ever used on my feet.</p>

This 40 gm of tub last me 5 times. It did take a bit time to dissolve and left a thin oil film on top of the water. I even felt a tingling sensation on my feet. 15 min and I could feel a liitle release in stress and just a rub of emery board and I am done :) would also like to add that, this has a very strong herbal smell, which many would not like.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Packaging is quite sturdy,</li>
	<li>It really soaks up my foot, I don't need to be really hard with foot scrub,</li>
	<li>I could feel a release in muscle tension, I can attribute that to warm water and the smell,</li>
	<li>Ingredients free from all harmful substances,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Although I have no complaints, but my sister could not stand the smell,</li>
	<li>I think its a bit pricey, as compared to other foot soaks,</li>
</ol>
I am definitely picking this up, as it really acts as superb foot soak. Although its pricey, but I would recommend it those, who wear open/high shoes and really need to comfort their heels and remove dirt easily. Just pair it with a good scrub and foot emery.
