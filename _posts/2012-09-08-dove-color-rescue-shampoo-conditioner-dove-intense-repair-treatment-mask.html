<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking care of colored hair can be so tricky sometimes, for me its a very hard task.. because I need to use scalp oil control shampoos and yet take care of my colored locks, hence I always end up exploiting the color in my hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7067.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4460" title="IMG_7067" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7067.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note:</em> Worst was when I first got my <em>highlights</em> done at Lakme, I have developed serious gray hair issues. If you are planning to get your hair colored make sure, you know how coloring works. If one of the steps involved is bleaching just stay away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I was saying, my previous experience with color protect products has not been very great or legendary, then I received the Dove Range my perception is slightly changed, not completely but yeah slightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7069.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4462" title="IMG_7069" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7069-e1347080582708.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love the creamy shampoo, which smells good and lathers well and does take care of color to an extent. My scalp is sensitive to harsh chemicals, over drying shampoos leave me with oily scalp in 10-12 hours and frizzy ends <em><strong>:sad:, </strong></em>but this one did worked perfectly for my thin and weak hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conditioner was quite ok, it did not provide enough moisture, so I had to use the Dove dry hair treatment. And the combo is rocking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7068.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4461" title="IMG_7068" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7068.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will definitely recommend this shampoo to all ladies, irrespective of hair and scalp type, but conditioner to gals with normal to oily/silky hair. Better opt for a better conditioner, I am still on a lookout for a great conditioner, which protects color, provides moisture, gives volume.... too much to ask <em><strong>:greedy me:</strong></em> But one day I shall find my HG conditioner... one day...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Which is your favorite product to protect colored hair ?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>*Dove Color Rescue Shampoo and conditioner were provided by the company as a launch event, but my opinion is honest... promise :)</strong></em></p>
