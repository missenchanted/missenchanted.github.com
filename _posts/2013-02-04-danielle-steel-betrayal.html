<h4>Book Review: Danielle Steel - Betrayal</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have always had a good read from Daniel Steel. She has this very unique way of introducing her characters. If you have read her books, I am pretty sure you will understand what that means. This is my third pick from her after <em>Lone Eagle</em> and <em><a href="http://www.mysmartprice.com/books/msp_book_single.php?q=9780552154727&amp;title=Sisters&amp;isbn=9780552154727&amp;img=iuuq%3B00d4%3A9865%2Fs65%2Fdg2%2Fsbdldeo%2Fdpn0%3A891663265838%2Fkqh" target="_blank">Sisters</a></em>. <em><a href="http://www.mysmartprice.com/books/msp_book_single.php?q=9780552159050&amp;title=Betrayal&amp;isbn=9780552159050&amp;img=iuuq%3B00d4%3A9865%2Fs65%2Fdg2%2Fsbdldeo%2Fdpn0%3A89166326%3A161%2Fkqh" target="_blank">Danielle Steel - Betrayal</a></em> is a story of a talented Hollywood Director and the betrayal she faces from the people she loved the most.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First 1-4 chapters dedicatedly emphasize on explaining the various characters again and again. I found some part of text repeated so many times in the book, that was really unnecessary and really boring.Â The plot is introduced a little later... but I must warn you, if you want to grab a copy of Betrayal then please do no read the summery of the book at the back else everything is very predictable. But then that's the case with every DS book that I have ever read. You will expect some changes or excitement during the read, but the story is very plain and simple.</p>

<strong>Why you should pick this book, because</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This book has emotions(<em>a lot of sobbing and warmth both</em>),</li>
	<li>If you are looking for a light read on your vacation.</li>
	<li>A story which promises optimism and leaves you with a smile on your face and a hope in your heart.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Why you should not read this,</strong>
<ul>
	<li>If you are looking from some suspense, thrill.</li>
</ul>

I would suggest you read <em>Sisters</em>, if you love your siblings... and miss them or give this a try on a oczy and comfotable weekend.

<em><strong>*This book was sent to me for review purpose, but my opinion remain unaffected. </strong></em>

<em><strong>*Any Daniel Steel fan here ? suggestion needed what should I pick up next from her ?</strong></em>
