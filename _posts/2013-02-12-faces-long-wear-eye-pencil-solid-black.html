<h4>Faces Canada Long Wear Eye Pencil  Solid Black  Review</h4>
Ever since I heard rave reviews about Lakme’s Kohl Ultimate I have been dying to pick it up! However, the steep cost at Rs 650 held me back. I got the Lakme Eyeconic Kajal but it is nowhere near jet black as I find it a tad greyish.

I happened to be at Faces Store in Mumbai in December and the SA insisting on swatching the Long Wear eye pencils on my arm. Since I had already purchased a ton Faces Long Wear pencils in grey, brown, blue and forest green during their 50 per cent sale, I didn’t pay much attention. But I was taken with the creaminess of the black eye pencil! This was just what I was looking for! A Kohl Ultimate dupe but at Rs 250.  Though I haven’t used the Lakme Kohl Ultimate I have swatched it enough to know that the consistency is similar.

In the photo I have compared Lakme Eyeconic and Faces. While I use Lakme Eyeconic for everyday use, the Faces pencil with smoky eye look or a more dramatic evening look. Since it’s so jet black I am careful of how I use it. Since I have droopy eyes, a thick black line makes it look droopier and even pops out too much in photos.  I use it to line the outer corners of my eyes to kinda lift the eyes.

Faces Long wear Eye Pencil in Solid Black is creamy, glides easily and it’s absolutely jet black. Moreover, it takes less than a minute to set and doesn’t budge. I have watery sensitive eyes and not too many eye pencils stay put for more than half an hour on my waterline. I have found that this stays put on my oily lids and waterline for about four hours but staying power would also depend on your skin type.

It’s easy to remove with cotton, baby oil or a local cleansing milk. The only drawback is that it comes in pencil  form and one tends to lose a lot of product while sharpening. However, if you don’t sharpen pencils to a ‘point’, you won’t waste product.

Since its so creamy, it can be used to tightline the base of the lashes. It smudges and blends very well if smudged before it sets. I use this in place of a good black eyeshadow for a smokey look. I know I don’t have eyes like Kareena so please excuse. Here is how it looks.

I will most certainly repurchase this. I do hope that they don’t change the formula. None of the other four pencils have such a pigmented creamy formula, so I am hoping it wasn’t just one of a kind.
