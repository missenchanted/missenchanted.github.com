I have developed this recent lust for LUSH products, I want to try out all scrubs, soaps etc etc etc :). So I started with the <strong>Karma soap</strong>. My first requirement to the SA was long lingering fragrance, and she instantly picked up this cherry colored soap with a strong fragrance.

<strong>Shelf life:</strong> 14 months

<strong>What I Love about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Its smell, and yeah it does stay for a real long time</li>
	<li>Content look all safe, but then that what we expect of LUSH</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I dont like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Quite expensive :(</li>
	<li>100 gm will last around 20 days</li>
	<li>Although it includes a mix of oils, but leaves my skin dry</li>
	<li>I feel its like evaporating from the shelf like camphor :( :(</li>
</ol>

Will not be buying this again, its quite expensive, fast exhausting and very drying.
