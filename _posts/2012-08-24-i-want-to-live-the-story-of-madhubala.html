<p style="text-align: justify;">I usually don't get emotional with books, but this one is an exception and left me with moist eyes. This book starts with the beauty of Madhubala, and you are left in a complete aw and disappointment, why I could never meet the angel beauty in real life.</p>
This book is full of pain, that Madhubala faced in her life.. and somehow I felt that pain when I kept on sweeping the pages. I wish Madhubala and Dilip shaahab had got a chance to reconcile.

Making of Mugale-azaam is an epic chapter and tells about the hardwork and simplicity of people those days.. I have already ordered a copy of the biggest saga ever made in India.

I have fallen in love with the most beautiful lady I have ever come across.....

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sorry I have been MIA, facing chronic headaches and have been suggested an MIR.. but I am still keeping a watch and keeping away from my laptop and yup my phone is dead.... Worst week ever but this book made up for everything :)</p>
