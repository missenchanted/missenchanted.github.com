<p style="text-align: center;">MASK... this one is truly the THE MASK... remember the men in yellow dress with a green mask</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">yup exactly <em>THE MASK</em> :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently picked up my first LUSH fresh face mask and just loving it. Love lettuce does look like shredded lettuce in a clay base but did I see lettuce in the ingredients, nope surprisingly I did not. But still no doubt its a great mask for normal to oily skin like mine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_6897.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4105" title="IMG_6897" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_6897.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
Â <strong>Price:</strong> Rs.520 for 100gm

<strong>Contains:</strong>

<strong>My Experience:</strong> My first thought after seeing, it looks liked Pista Kaju Icecream and take a sniff, wow it smells the same. It has grounded almonds hence feels a little gritty and works as mask cum scrub. Take a small quantity, mix it with water and leave on for 7-10 min, scrub it slowly out and wash with warm water.

It feels fresh and gives a glow, which does last for like a day. I wont say this does wonders, I would say its an average mask for normal-oily skin, but since its completely natural and fresh, I like it. Also the scrub is very gentle and can be used everyday.

Major disadvantage is short life span of 2 weeks and it needs to be stored in refrigerator.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Fresh and natural ingredients,</li>
	<li>Works as mask cum scrub,</li>
	<li>Does not dry up the skin, leave behind soft and glowing skin,</li>
	<li>I quite like the smell n color, but thats just me I think,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I wish they give masks in lesser quantities, since life span is so short,</li>
	<li>Has to be stored in refrigerator,</li>
	<li>Glow does not last long</li>
</ol>
I love LUSH products, but the policy of minimum purchase should not stand for masks I believe, its quite hard to finish them off in 2 weeks, and who uses masks daily.

Will I buy this again, yes I will and will recommend this to Normal-Oily skin people only on if they can use it daily and finish off in 2 weeks.

<em><strong>Which is your favorite LUSH fresh face mask ?</strong></em>
