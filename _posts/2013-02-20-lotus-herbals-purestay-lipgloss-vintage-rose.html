<h4>Lotus Herbals purestay lipgloss vintage rose</h4>
I was at big bazaar the other day for grocery shopping, that’s when the SA at the lotus herbals  told me about the discounts going on. I was actually looking for a lipstick, but all they had was brown and maroon, so I asked them for some gloss instead. Let me tell you, I am not a gloss person at all. But after swatching this baby for the first time, I knew I was gonna take Lotus Herbals purestay lipgloss vintage rose  home with me.

<strong>Price:</strong> 395/- I got it for around 300/-

Lotus Herbals purestay lipgloss comes in an attractive box packaging, which also contains a pamphlet about the other products from the same range. The tube is shining, glossy and very sexy, it stands apart from the other lippies in my vanity. The quantity is 8 gms. which is definitely very good.

It has the creamiest texture I have ever seen in a lip gloss. When I applied it for the first time, I felt that it is going to be another heavy lip gloss, but I was wrong. It settles down within seconds and gives you a very light feel. I won’t say that it is non-sticky.

Another good thing is the absence of  shimmer. So it looks more like a shining liquid lipstick than a gloss. I am loving it.

It covers the pigmentation of my upper lip very well. I don’t need to apply a lipstick underneath and I can wear it on its own easily. The SA claimed it to last for 8 hours which I knew can’t be possible. And I was right. It stays for 2 hours on me like freshly applied and then a little subtle for next 2 hours, then I end up eating something everytime so I am unable to judge its staying power for more than 4-5 hours. But for a gloss I think it’s pretty good.

The shade I picked is vintage rose. It’s a beautiful deep pink color which will definitely not wash you out. I am always scared of pinks as I have yellow undertones but I rock this pink shade with total ease. It will look good on all kind of complexions.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Very affordable</li>
	<li>Good quantity for the price</li>
	<li>Creamy and luscious.</li>
	<li>Stays good for 4-5 hours.</li>
	<li>Very good collection of shades</li>
	<li>100% natural, no preservatives (at least that’s what they say)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I didn’t find any con with this lip gloss.</li>
</ol>
Being not a gloss lover and founding not even a single con in this gloss, I am sure you all must have come to know how much I am loving it. I suggest all of you to give this a try. It is actually worth it.

<em><strong>My expectations are high from purestay range now, gonna try their so raved foundation next.  How about you ?</strong></em>
