<h4>Revlon Skin lights Face Illuminator</h4>
I was always scared of glitters/shimmer in fact I am still to an extent, but Revlon Skin lights Face Illuminator changed my opinion about using sparkle and glitter in my makeup. The way it makes my face glow is just too awesome.

<strong>Price: </strong>Rs<strong>.</strong>750, I bought it at 30% discount for Rs.525

<strong>Shelf life: </strong>3 Years

<strong>Packaging:</strong> The box is bulky and the plastic looks cheap. But I can say it is sturdy. I must say that the packaging doesn’t give you a feeling as if you’ve spent 700 bucks.

The shade I got is golden light and the company says that it is suited for wheatish skintone. Although I have fair skin tone, the SA convinced me to buy golden light, I am still wondering how.

But I have no such complaints, because it doesn’t make me look dull or anything.  In fact it makes my face glow like nothing can. I have tried oriflame peach me glow perfect and I am sure most of the ladies out there would also have. Those who haven’t, it’s a tinted moisturizer with subtle shimmer in it. (it’s the fastest selling product of oriflame and is always out of stock). But this Revlon beauty is nothing like it.

You can use it the way you want , all over the face or as a highlighter. I prefer using it as a highlighter. <em>“Less is more”</em> policy goes with it. You actually need a very very little amount for single application. The brush they provide is just okayish, the bristles are hard. I prefer my own blusher brush for that. All you need to do is invert the box in closed cap condition, then put it back straight, open the lid, take the powder on your brush, tap the excess and apply it on your forehead, cheekbones, nose, chin.

I know the color is not showing up but what can I do..it’s such a subtle shimmer.

You can also apply it all over the face by mixing it with your foundation. But remember, <em>less is always more</em>. This can be a good product for brides as it gives a very beautiful glow and sheen to your face so even if you’re tired, this can make you look glowing in those family dinners and get togethers.

<strong>Pros-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Blends Superbly.</li>
	<li>Very refined texture.</li>
	<li>Travel friendly packaging.</li>
	<li>Has a brush included</li>
	<li>Very little amount is required for highlighting.so it is actually gonna last long.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Definitely costly (as we don’t use highlighters and glitters on a regular basis, at least I don’t do that).</li>
	<li>Brush is not of good quality.</li>
	<li>Packaging is not attractive.</li>
</ul>
Overall a very nice product for party people. But I can’t see myself buying it again as I don’t use it much and the cost is pretty high. And it is gonna take ages to get over.

<em><strong>Do you also include shimmer in your makeup ?</strong></em>
