Bought this product a year back at Singapore Airport, just an impulsive buy but definitely a good one. Mascara is like a daily routine product, since I love eye makeup and just cannot do without a kohl, eyeliner and mascara when I step out.

<strong>Content:</strong> No idea :(

<strong>What I love about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>One of the best quality applicator brush,</li>
	<li>Apt consistency, great coverage, no lumps, doesn't stick the lashes</li>
	<li>Even after the tube finished, I still carry this as lash brush</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong> Nothing as such, but availability can be a problem

<strong>Whats your favorite mascara ?</strong>
