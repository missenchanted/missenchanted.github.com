I recently picked up this beauty @50% from <a href="http://lushindia.com/vmchk/New/View-all-products/">here</a>. How could I have said no to such cute looking dibbi and such adorable color at such throwaway price :). Celebrate lip tint is a part of LUSH Christmas collection.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2820.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2443" title="IMG_2820" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2820.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 570

<strong>Lush says:</strong> Our fizzing champagne lip balm and tint. Most lips need a little extra help in the winter months, and if you have to keep putting lip balms on, then why not have them tasting and feeling like pink champagne? We’ve tried to create that effect here. We’ve taken almond oil, organic jojoba oil and camellia oil to moisturise your lips and keep them safe from the winter weather. Then we added icing sugar, cognac oil, grapefruit oil and lemon oil to make it taste great. We then added a blend of colours to give a subtle pink tint to the lips and stop you looking washed out in the cold. Then we finished it off with a little topping of bubbles, in the form of popping candy and edible gold lustre. Who’d have thought a lip tint could be this much fun? It means protecting your lips stops being a chore and becomes something to celebrate. And we all know, it’s more fun if you don’t celebrate alone…

<strong>Ingredients:</strong> Almond Oil, Japan Wax, Icing Sugar, Organic Jojoba Oil, Popping Candy, Camellia Oil, Flavour, Talc, Cocoa Butter, Lemon Oil, Grapefruit Oil, Cognac Oil, Golden Lustre, Titanium Dioxide, *Limonene, *Linalool, *Citral, Colour 73360, Colour 77019 *occurs naturally in essential oils

<strong>My Experience:</strong> When I first opened it, I assumed the candy particles to be some shimmer particles, but they are indeed candy and a waste, so first step would be remove them before use. It has a shimmery metalic finish which instantly washes me out. Although LUSH says this is a lip balm, but its neither moisturizing nor drying. I first use a layer of lip balm, then LUSH tint followed by a clear gloss else my lips look metallic :(

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The fragrance is candy like, which I totally love,</li>
	<li>Packaging is real cute</li>
</ol>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">What I did not like:</span></strong></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Candy particles on top are a total waste, you should remove them else they waste a lot of product,</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Not a lip balm for sure as claimed,</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Metallic finish a negative for me, if I top it with a clear gloss, it looks more better.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
If you don't like strong fragrance and metallic lip shades this is not for you. I will surely want to try the Snow fairy which is more of a sheer color with candy fragrance.

Have you tried any LUSH lip tint?
