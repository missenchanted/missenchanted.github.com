I have tried quite some stuff from Avon's color and nail range, and this is my first body wash from Avon, which I grabbed on sale again on the onset of winters. <strong>Milk and honey</strong> was enough to convince me that it will work for me during winters. I have been using this for almost 2 months and have a lot to say about this.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 149 for 200ml, I got this at Rs.129

<strong>My Experience:</strong> This was more of an impulsive buy and I did not have very high expectations, but its has proved itself worth every penny. It comes in a yellow plastic container with a flip cap, which looks decent and rather cute. But I am not very sure that its travel friendly due to its bulky size and flip opening. It smells a blend of vanilla and honey which for me is the biggest plus point. Lathers well, and does not leave me dry.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Very decently priced,</li>
	<li>Love the vanilla and honey smell,</li>
	<li>Lathers and cleans well,</li>
	<li>Does not leave my skin dry in winters, although a lotion is a must after this.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Packaging is not travel friendly,</li>
	<li>Can be purchased only through Avon consultants.</li>
</ol>
This is going to last me for some more time, then I would like to try something for Summers. But I might switch back to this for next winters.

<em><strong>I would highly recommend this product, at this price it wont even burn a hole into the pocket.</strong></em>
