<p style="text-align: justify;">How is your weekend coming, mine just got better with the sales floating around. I am already bankrupt but so proud of picking up some real good pieces in this sale. If you have read few of my earlier post, I am sure you must have remembered the <em><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/what-came-in-my-mail/" target="_blank">beautiful and enchanting basket</a></span></strong></em> that I received from Parachute with Advanced Body Lotions and some really cute goodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7626.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5296" title="IMG_7626" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7626.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been using these for the last 2 weeks now, and quite satisfied with the results and specially the price tag. With winters almost gone by I consider this as a bit late post as these could have been your best budget buddies. But better late than never, lets get started with the two variants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Parachute Advanced Body Lotion Deep Nourish for Extra Dry Skin:  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 160 for 400ml</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7827.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5664" title="IMG_7827" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7827.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7830.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5661" title="IMG_7830" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7830.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a variant for skin that need some extra care and moisturizer this winter. It comes in a beautiful lavender pump packaging, which is curvy and looks good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lotion is claimed to contain coconut milk as the main ingredient, which nourishes and makes the skin soft and supple. I specially love the fragrance, some people may find it a bit strong when applied, but it fades in few minutes to slight subtle hint of fragrance on your skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This lotion lasts 8-9 hours in AC conditions, which is good enough on my record.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I definitely suggest this to everyone looking for a good body lotion under budget and specially if you love the subtle fragrance that lingers on your skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Parachute Advanced Body Lotion Soft Touch for Dry Skin:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 115 for 250ml</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7831.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5662" title="IMG_7831" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7831.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7832.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5663" title="IMG_7832" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_7832.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a lighter lotion for skin, for mild winters and regular use. The packaging is almost same curvy bottle in mint but without a pump.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>If you are not a fan of fragrance lotion then this one is definitely for you. It has virtually no smell, instantly gets absorbed and the effect lasts me 5-6 hours under AC conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Verdict:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My only concern with these moisturizers is the lack of SPF. It becomes very tedious and time consuming to first apply these moisturizers and then move onto sunscreens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall these have to be on the top budget picks of the season. Both the variations serve to both the skin needs of heavy moisture dose and slight little care.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Whats your opinion about Parachute Advanced Body Lotions, have you tried these yet ?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>*Product was sent by the company, but that has not affected the review.</strong></em></p>
