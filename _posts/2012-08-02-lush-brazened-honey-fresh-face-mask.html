This week has been so hectic, office chores have been eating up my complete day.  So many times the idea of quitting has passed my mind, and even though I have so many plans for myself but the golden words haven't yet taken the shape.

Coming to Lush Fresh face masks, I am a fan and this one is no exception,  just the <del>shelf</del> refrigrator life and the minimum quantity purchase plays such a spoil sport I tell you,

Here I go Lush Brazened Honey Fresh Face Mask ...

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_6942.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4158" title="IMG_6942" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_6942.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.620 for 100gm

<strong>Contains:</strong>

<strong>Claims: </strong> A powerhouse of effective ingredients for all tired skins. Refreshing herbs and fruit juice are blended with warming Ayurvedic herbs and spices. With almonds to polish and moisturizing honey, this blend leaves the skin vibrant and reinvigorated. Apply to clean skin, avoiding the eye area. Leave for five to ten minutes, then rinse with warm water massaging gently. Keep chilled.

<strong>My Experience: </strong>When I first went through the ingredients, I was very much convinced that its meant for normal to dry skin. But when SA suggested to give it a try, oh boy I was so wrong. Unlike other LUSH fresh face masks, this one dries up so quickly, and feels almost like clay based masks. Even though LUSH says to remove the mask before drying, which it does in like 3-4 minutes, I keep it on for at least 10 min. My Oily skin feels pampered, the grounded Almonds work as mild yet effective scrub.

Even though it has egg, but believe me it smells good and looks like some salad dressing :)

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Absorbs oil, and leaves behind clean and moisturized skin,</li>
	<li>Grounded almonds give mild scrubbing action,</li>
	<li>Fresh and natural ingredients</li>
</ol>
<div><strong>What I did not like:</strong></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>You have to keep it in refrigerator,</li>
	<li>Minimum purchase amount, which is hard to finish off in 3 weeks,</li>
</ol>

Will totally recommend this to Oily skinned beauties, since this dries up very quickly. I am gonna repurchase this for sure, even though I have to use it daily else I can't manage to finish it off in 3 weeks.

<strong>Whats your recipe of Honey Mask ?</strong>
