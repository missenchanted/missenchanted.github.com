<h4>Revlon ColorSilk Review Dark Brown</h4>
The other day I had gone hunting for my favorite <em>Well Hair Color in Dark Brown</em> since I just could not find it online. I checked it at a nearby Health and glow store, but the SA told me that Wella hair color is no more available, due to some marketing issues and something like that. I was left in a fix for my experience with Wella Hair color has been great. Unlike Loreal, Wella always gave me soft and beautifully glossy colored hair. So when I was about to pick Revlon ColorSilk in Dark Brown, the SA insisted that I opt for Revlon Top Speed as it can color my hair in just 5 minutes.

I just compared the two products, and picked up the Rs. 300 ColorSilk instead of Top Speed which sells for Rs.549. I wanted to check can really a 300 bucks hair color work ?
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8214.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6931" title="IMG_8214" alt="Revlon ColorSilk Review Dark Brown" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8214.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a> I do have few gray hair, so my first concern was to covers the grays and then a beautiful glossy hair. The pack comes with a pack of developer and a bottle of color, the usual pair of gloves and a conditioner satchet. <!--more--> <a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8215.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6932" title="IMG_8215" alt="Revlon ColorSilk Review Dark Brown" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8215.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a> It works like other colors, mix the developer and the bottle content. Evenly apply through hair and leave on for 25-30 min and then wash off with luke warm water. Apply the conditioner for 3-5 min and done.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had a slight buring sensation on the scalp, I wanted to quit as the thought of going bald was freaking me out. But I <del>bravely</del> sat through.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was really surprised that a Rs. 300 hair color actually worked fine for my hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the gray got covered, it did give me soft and glossy hair. However not as glossy as Wella. Its been three weeks, the color is good, my hair is soft and I am fully satisfied with the product. <a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8216.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6933" title="IMG_8216" alt="Revlon ColorSilk Review Dark Brown" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8216.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a> <em><strong>Have you tried Revlon ColorSilk ? Do you also share my opinion on this ?</strong></em></p>
