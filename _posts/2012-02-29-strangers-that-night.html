<p style="text-align: justify;">It was my first day to Office in South Korea and I had no clue about the unpredictable weather I was going to witness,(Although Koreans have a very accurate prediction when it comes to weather forecast ;)).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyways, and there I was without an umbrella. I planned to enjoy the rains while moving back to the guest house, but I only realized after getting drenched that the water was bloody freezing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now there was no stopping, and so I increased my pace, suddenly I find a korean guy running behind me with an umbrella, amazingly he approached quite fast.Using his very limited character SET he tried to greet and offered his Umbrella</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now why on the earth will a guy offer me umbrella in this chilling rains ????????.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thanked him politely and told him I was comfortable in the rain, but he couldn't understand anything except THANKS I believe. I tried explaining using Hand gestures " I DONT NEED UMBRELLA" but he was still standing there with his same innocent smile and so I gave up, and walked with him.I don't remember his name and very frankly I forgot it the very moment he introduced himself, but I am not at fault believe me :D. He tried his level best to explain his work at the Office, and the only word I could make out was Electronics, fascinating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We parted ways at the station and I stood at a red traffic light, shivering so hard that my bones could feel the vibrations, and maybe God was keeping a vigilant eye on me, that he sent a very old lady almost half my height and triple my age , she offered her umbrella. I used almost all hand signs all word that have learnt my entire life, but the lady stood there smiling, maybe amazed with the kind of funny language I was using. I gave up, and the second light turned green I started running, guess what this lady also started running after me. I guess Koreans Love running :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and she did not stop until she brought me under that umbrella and dropped me till the guest house, no word exchanged between us, just the smiles and eyes did the entire conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I still look back that night and only thing that comes to me is a smile and their innocent face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">alas I can't even remember her face, It took me a week to identify ppl in Korea :D</p>
