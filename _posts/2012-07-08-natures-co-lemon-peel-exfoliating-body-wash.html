<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer is all about Citrus and Mint fragrance to me, they just lift up the spirits and give an extra fresh feel. When it comes to citrus I just love the Lemon and Satsuma range from The Body Shop. I received two sample sized Nature's Co Lemon Peel Exfoliating Body Wash in February edition of Blisscovered, who are lost in the woods somewhere.</p>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 775 for 250ml
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Claims:</strong> Gently exfoliates and makes skin clean &amp; fresh. Acts as a great astringent, improving its luster and makes lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This clean fresh extract of Lemon Peel not only is a great astringent that helps firm skins elasticity but also balances the pH of the skin which increases the luster of dull and tired looking skin by lightening it mildly. Kiwi seeds &amp; Walnut grits gently exfoliate the skin leaving smooth &amp; renewed. In the shower or bath, spread the scrub over your entire body. Rub it in to exfoliate &amp; then rinse well. It will leave you feeling smooth all over.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> Comes in a tube packaging, which is definitely helpful and travel friendly. Smells citrus and has small exfoliating beads. Lathers up really good and leaves behind refreshed skin. Only if the price tag could be a bit lower, I might have bought it again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Citrus smell, and fresh feel,</li>
	<li>Exfoliating beads,</li>
	<li>Does not dry up the skin,</li>
	<li>Fragrance does not stay on the skin</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Price tag,</li>
</ol>
Except the price tag there is absolutely there is nothing wrong with this product. I shall move back to my favorite Satsuma range whose smell lingers for hours in my washroom, just love that.
