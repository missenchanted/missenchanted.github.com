This week was all about lights... after burning some heavy oil in the office last week, I needed some shopping therapy and it came with a lot of good luck.. how ??... keep on reading...

Started with purchase of lights for my house, and I got exactly what I wanted. Had to surf though the streets of Chikpet Bangalore.. which by the way is Â a house to some killer silk sarees I swear.

Finally zeroed down on these, and brought them home. The Wooden background blends with the decor,

A day well spent at FabIndia Bangalore, I browsed though Kormangala and Indiranagar outlets. Picked up a couple of Table linen and a lamp that too again in wood.

This Lamp well suited my decor, as was so much in budget, infact I was shocked to see the price.. since I picked it up from Fabindia,

Got a lot of bling lights and my Balcony is disco dancing right away, and this is how my society looks at midnight.. purely divine na ?

And how could the holiday season go by without a little bit of indulgence, that would be cheating. So I picked up few regulars and some new comers from LUSH.. oh yes and my furniture finally arrived phew.. so another post following that :)

Oops forgot to mention about luck thing right... I played teen patti for the first time.. and won everything that was on board and came back with a little heavy wallet.. he he..
