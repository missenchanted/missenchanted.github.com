<p style="text-align: justify;">How many of us check for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_laureth_sulfate">SLS</a>, silicons and parabens before picking up shampoo and conditioners. To me this is a newly acquired habit :P, and after a lot of research online I zeroed onto TBS rainforest series. They are the only SLS free products I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2904.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2651" title="IMG_2904" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2904.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What the product Claims:</strong>
It contains no silicones, sulphates, parabens or colourants. It also meets our eco-conscious standard. It is respectful to the aquatic environment, meets strict biodegradability standards, and minimises the use of non-sustainable packaging resources. Conditions to smooth hair's surface for incredible shine and prolonged radiance. Contains pracaxi oil, cam√©line seed oil and Community Trade olive oil and aloe vera. No silicones, parabens or colourants.

For normal to dry hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 515 for 250ml.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My experience:</strong> To me this product is a total waste, I would count it as the worst purchase of 2011. I am not sure whom to blame the conditioner or the hard water at my place. Neither did this provide any moisture, shine, nor did it make my hair any softer and detangled. The very basic requirement to detangle the locks is not even fulfilled even when its specifically meant for dry hair. I did not expect this from TBS, who have such fabulous skin/hair care products which I myself love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2905.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2652" title="IMG_2905" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2905.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>What I liked:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Does not contain SLS, paraben and silicones.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Not at all moisturizing,</li>
	<li>No shine even for Norma hair,</li>
	<li>Neither softens the hair, nor detangles them,</li>
	<li>Very pricey when compared with other TBS conditioners,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am very sure I will be not picking anything from this range. I will go back to my Earlier TBS conditioners I am ok with SLS now :D</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Have you tried TBS Rainforest series yet ?</strong></em></p>
