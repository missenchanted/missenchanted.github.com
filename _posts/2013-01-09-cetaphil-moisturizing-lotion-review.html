I have always been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for my face. I hate thick lotions for my face as they leave a sticky, greasy layer and make my already oily skin look even oilier. Most of the lotions that I have tried have given me breakouts and thus, I have broken up with them. Well, I bought the Cetaphil Moisturizing lotion when I saw it in a pharmacy, lying on a rack, beside my favorite Cetaphil cleanser. Without any thoughts, I bought it and have been trying it out since 3 months.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:- </strong>This lotion is quite thick in consistency, is white and fragrance free. The lotion is so thick that I have to shake the bottle very hard to take out the lotion. I tried it on my face one day and found out that it simply makes my face very oily and greasy. I immediately understood that it is not for my sensitive oily skin. I tried it out on my neck, knees, and elbows and found out that it makes them soft and supple. I used it for my feet as well and it works perfectly for them. I got slight cracks on my heels and within a few days only, I saw that the cracks were healed. It moisturizes my body perfectly too. It is slightly expensive and will not work for the face.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It did not break me out though. My daughter loves to use it on her very dry skin and loves it. Therefore, I am sure all the dry skin beauties will love it.</p>
