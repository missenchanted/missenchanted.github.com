<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>"Baby your skin"</strong></em>, just love those words, who doesn't want to be pampered and get that baby feel back. Not quite impressed with this piece though... why???</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6125.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3125" title="IMG_6125" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6125-600x400.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 200 (Got it for Rs. 120 from Fashionandyou)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About the Soap:</strong> Can you have baby soft skin? We combine natural skin foods like papayas, cucumbers along with yogurt to make a solid facial cleansing bar, that will give you the soft, smooth, silky skin that you could only dream about. Skin impurities are drawn out, pores tightened, skin inflamations cooled down. <em>
Baby Your Skin Soap Removes makeup, dirt &amp; oil without any chemical additives.Use for allÂ  facial skin types twice daily, in the morning &amp; before bedtime.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contains:</strong> Fresh papayas &amp; cucumber, thai white clay, yogurt, Vitamin E, glycerin, aqua, olive, rice bran, coconut, castor &amp; palm oil.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6126.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3126" title="IMG_6126" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6126-600x400.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> I like Soulflower soaps in general and had some high expectations just because the Soap's name itself promises so many things. Although this soap is very moisturizing but the smell is a turn off. It smells like a concoction of Hot chocolate, yogurt and something weird. My sister was like Ewww :(</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I never try soap on my face, but did try this one. It was very foaming yet gentle and did not dry my skin at all, but my nose was not happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6127.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3127" title="IMG_6127" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6127-400x600.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></a><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Soap is indeed very moisturizing, it did not even dry the facial skin.. bravo,</li>
	<li>Once I reached the inner layer, I could feel a little scrub action, nothing harsh,</li>
	<li>Does not melt like crazy, like other soaps,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Definitely the smell, no one liked it,</li>
	<li>Although its easily available online, but in store present only with Shopper stop &amp; Home stop,</li>
</ol>
This could have been a perfect soap, only if the smell was a bit pleasing. I am not going to purchase this again. There are lot of Soulflower soaps to try out yet.
