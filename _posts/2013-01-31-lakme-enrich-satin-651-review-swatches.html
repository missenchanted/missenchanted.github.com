<h4>Lakme Enrich Satin 651 review &amp; swatches</h4>
I recently purchased the Lakme Enrich Satin Lipstick 651 from a local cosmetic shop and thought of reviewing it on the blog! I did not swatch this lipstick at the store and was surprised to see that the bullet has a yellowish-orange color! However, I love it a lot! Do you want to know why I love it, inspite of the misleading lipstick Bullet? Read on…

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 225

<strong>My experience: </strong>Well, this Lipstick came with a plastic wrapped around it with the quantity written on it and some contact information mentioned. Can you imagine that no price was written anywhere on the lipstick? I removed the plastic wrap and saw a non-attractive, maroon case, which I did not like much. I opened the cap of the lipstick and sniffed at it. The smell is very awkward and like that of medicines. The smell lingers on for 30 minutes or so.

I saw the shade and freaked out, but as I applied it on my lips, I was surprised. It gave my lips a healthy pink glow as the color turned out to be sheer pink. I quite loved it. I have been using it for quite a few days and I love it a lot now. The lovely color it gives to my lips is the reason why I have fallen in love with it.

One thing I hated is that they did not mention the price and ingredients on the lipstick or on the plastic wrap. I also hated the fact that it does not cover pigmentation. It has a staying power of around 3 hours without any meals in between. Packaging is sturdy and the lipstick is travel friendly.
