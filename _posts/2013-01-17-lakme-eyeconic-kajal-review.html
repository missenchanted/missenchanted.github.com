Last year was all about so many product release from Lakme, Maybelline, Revlon etc. But one that caught my attention the most was the Lakme Eyeconic range, I have been using them for the last 2-3 month and am highly impressed.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 199

<strong>Claims:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Smudge proof</li>
	<li>Waterproof</li>
	<li>Lasts 10hours</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok all the claims are actually true, and I am currently loving this more than any black eyeliner that I have in my kit for the same price range. The retractable packing and new looks from Lakme certainly defines this new range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its soft and does not tug and pull the eye. Intensely pigmented and a true black. Lasts me 8-9 hours on the eyelid, but on my waterline it stays for like 4-5hours and then slightly starts to fade away, without making me look like a panda</p>

Highly impressed with Lakme for providing such good quality Kohl in the price range.

<em>Ok do I hear... how this fares against Maybelline Collosal Kajal ??</em>

Maybelline kajal does not stand any chance infront of Lakme eye conic range. I have had hard time getting a true black on my waterline with Maybelline one and it always fails.

Slight smudge test, and as you see it does budge slightly but still I am ok with it. Lakme has also launched eyeconic Mascara to go with this and that too is my good list. More on that in my next post.

If you are a kohl addict, or even if you like it sometimes only.. Lakme eyeconic Kajal is for you and everyone. I highly recommend this.
