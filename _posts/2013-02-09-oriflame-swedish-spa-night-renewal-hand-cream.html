<h4>Oriflame Swedish Spa Night renewal Hand Cream</h4>
I am so much into Oriflame products now days that my friends have started teasing me that Oriflame is going to send me a nice and heavy cheque or gift hamper for increasing their turnover drastically. I really wish they do so... today the product I am going to talk about is Oriflame Swedish Spa Night renewal Hand Cream.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Oriflame-Swedish-Spa-Night-renewal-Hand-Cream.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6174" title="Oriflame Swedish Spa Night renewal Hand Cream" alt="Oriflame Swedish Spa Night renewal Hand Cream" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Oriflame-Swedish-Spa-Night-renewal-Hand-Cream.jpg" width="900" height="675" /></a></p>
This hand cream was a purchase for winters, when my hands were terribly parched and dry. So on my quest to find something good enough for my hand i stumbled into this cream.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs259 for 75 ml.

<em>I got it at a discount for Rs 180.</em>

Oriflame Swedish Spa Night renewal Hand Cream is a part of Oriflame's swedish spa range. It comes in a white tube with a sturdy flip flop cap. Nothing fancy but nothing bad either. It has a normal creamy texture and gets absorbed within 10-15 seconds  of application. Although this cream is a night renewal hand cream. but it is not that worthy. First of all, being a night  TREATMENT, I expected it to be thicker in consistency. But the  cream gets absorbed within seconds of application and I feel like I have applied nothing. Well, I still go to sleep hoping that next  day I am going to wake up with supple hands but nothing happens. My hands are just like what they would be if i had applied any regular cream.

Swedish spa range from oriflame is raved for its fragrance part, but i quite don’t understand the fuss. True, this cream has a unique smell but it doesn’t seem good or appealing to me. I asked my mom and my husband about it and they both said that it’s weird. Even they were unsure as what kind of a smell is that. After trying many a times i could finally find out...it smells like cinnamon.

<strong>Pros-</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Not so costly.</li>
	<li>Absorbs easily (for me it’s not the best, because it’s a night cream and i expect it to be rich and intense.)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Cons-</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I did not like the smell, nothing spa or luxurious about it,</li>
	<li>Don't fool yourself with this night renewal thing. It’s just a normal hand cream.</li>
</ol>
I am still waiting for my proyouth hand cream to arrive. I really have high expectations from it. I am on my quest for my HG(<em>Holy Grail</em>) hand cream for my ultra-dry hands.....sigh sigh sigh!!!

<em><strong>Which is you Favorite hand cream fro dry hands ?</strong></em>
