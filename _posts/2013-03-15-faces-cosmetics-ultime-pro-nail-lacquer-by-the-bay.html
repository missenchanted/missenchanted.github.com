<p style="text-align: left;">I liked the nail paint brush, the bristle length is a bit short but the density helps to cover a nail in a single swipe. The formula is not runny and dries up within seconds, but I still allow it a minute to settle. The formula is non streaky, even if you are clumsy with paints, it will still give you a shiny and smooth coat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This shade is a very pigmented shade, one swipe will be enough to get the exact shade on your nails, but I have used two coats in the picture. I have not used any base and top coat in the pictures, as I did not feel any requirement. Started noticing slight chipping after 4 days, which is quite ok when compared to some other good nail paints.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although price might seem a bit on higher side, but the quality is worth it.</p>
