  al2fb_facebook_excerpt: There is no doubt, that this is one of the most gentle toners
    i have ever used, very mild, fragrance free. Will recommend it to anyone with
    sensitive skin with closed eyes. But for oily skin, its not much of a help as
    it does nothing to tame the pores :(

<p style="text-align: justify;">Had picked up this toner around a year back, was using this very sparsely initially but since last 3 months having been using it religiously twice a day. Toning is an essential part of skin routine and its very necessary to identify the right kind of toner for your skin type. Toning not only cleanses the pores but also shrinks them temporarily :)</p>
Although I have oily skin and I am supposed to use toner with slight alcohol content, but still I thought of giving it a try since I knew its very gentle plus review around the web were really good.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0745.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782" title="IMG_0745" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0745.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="675" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 545 for 200ml (Got it for 490 in a sale)<!--more--></p>
<strong>Product boasts of:</strong> Instantly calm your sensitive skin, while removing impurities and excess traces of cleanser, with a conditioning, alcohol-free toner.
The aloe vera used in the product is the highest quality aloe vera .It is hand collected, hand washed and hand prepared.

<strong>Product contains:</strong> Aqua (Water) (Solvent/Diluent), Aloe barbadensis (Aloe Vera Gel) (Skin Soothing Agent), Pentylene Glycol (Solvent), Butylene Glycol (Humectant), Sorbitol (Humectant), Glycerin (Humectant).

<strong>What i liked about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Very gentle, contains glycerin and aloe vera,</li>
	<li>Very light on face, once dried you wont feel anything on skin, plus skin looks clearer,</li>
	<li>This product did not break me out.</li>
	<li>Alcohol free :) (Excess of alcohol dries out oily skin, which in turn leads to more oil so be cautious)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like about the product</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>It did nothing to the pores, there was no tightening or shrinking :(</li>
	<li>Takes some time to dry on skin, so if you are in a hurry to apply makeup.. skip this,</li>
	<li>I also wish toners some in a spray bottle, its more hygienic plus cotton need not be rubbed on sensitive skin.</li>
</ol>
