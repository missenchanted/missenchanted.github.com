<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>MUA Pro Brow Ultimate Eyebrow Kit Review and Swatches - All-in-one Shape, Shade and Highlight</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>I was introduced to the concept of brow kit by The Body  shop, but I found it a bit chalky and that's where my date with brow kits ended. Heard some rave reviews about the Sleek Makeup brow kit and was really tempted to pick it up, but I suppose the price tag did not encourage me that much. But when I saw the MUA Pro brow ultimate eyebrow kit for just £3.50, there were no second thoughts and it went straight to my checkout page.</span></p>

<strong>Price: </strong>£3.50, available online

Create brows that are fuller, thicker and more defined with 3 shades + a fixing gel

The mirror I suppose should be able to hold itself, but I suppose I got a faulty piece, and it just can't keep up and falls down. The kit includes a pair of tweezers, a handy brush, set of three powders and a fixing gel.

This kit comes in only one shade but It will suit most Indian skin tones from fair to dusky beauties..

<strong> How to use:</strong>

I quite loved the effect this kit gives to your brows. Well defined and full eyebrows give a glow to the face and defines the forehead. 2 minutes are enough to get beautiful eyebrows.

I am not a tweezers person, because my pain threshold is lower than that of a baby, and the brush is good enough to fill the eyebrows but I need a soft brush for the paler shades.</span>

Overall its a complete kit in itself. Since I got a flimsy packaging, I am not sure how sturdy and travel friendly this is.

I definitely recommend having at least one brow kit in your vanity. It does make a difference to your face. Since MUA kit is a good bet for a fabulous price tag, I would seriously recommend this to everyone.
