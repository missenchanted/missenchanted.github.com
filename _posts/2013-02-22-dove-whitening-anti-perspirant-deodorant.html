<strong>My Experience with Dove Whitening Anti-Perspirant Deodorant</strong>

I have been using this since 1.5 months now and completely hate it. I hate the fragrance, the texture, the effects and everything else except the packaging.

The first day when tried it, I was super excited and as it got absorbed quickly and left no layer behind. Second day tried it again and got a slight burning sensation. However I ignored it. Next day, I saw a horrible blackish- brown spot on my under-arm area. The Deodorant had burnt the skin leaving behind a brown spot. It has been such a long time since then but the spot is still there.

I completely love all other Dove products and, thus out of respect, I tried it again. This time, it turned super powdery and my under arms became ghastly white.

Next day I tried again and it was all sticky. It did not get absorbed properly  and left the slimy layer behind.  This product is super confusing and all its claims are FALSE. This is my personal experience.

Finally, there is another con. When I spray it my whole room turns foggy. It contains such a lot of gas. This is not good for the health too. It completely turns the under arm area rough, though does not dry them out.

<strong>PROS-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Packaging is nice</li>
	<li>Long Lasting Fragrance</li>
</ul>
<strong>CONS-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Burnt my under arm skin slightly and I have a brown spot which has not faded since a long time now</li>
	<li>I don’t want to smell like Dove soap everywhere</li>
	<li>Does not get absorbed completely</li>
	<li>Gives <em>rough</em> under arm area</li>
	<li>Sometimes leaves a sticky layer behind (<em>Like glue</em>)</li>
	<li>Sometimes leaves a <em>very powdery</em> layer</li>
	<li>Everything else you can think of is a CON</li>
</ul>
<strong>Final Verdict-</strong> DO NOT purchase this EVER. Definitely not for sensitive under arms. Does not whiten the under arm area rather makes it ROUGH. Complete Wastage of money for me.
