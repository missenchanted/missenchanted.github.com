<h4>Oriflame Very Me Double Trouble Eye Pencil &amp; Very Me Eye Envy Eye Shadow</h4>
<blockquote>I love trouble, and when its double I love it more....</blockquote>
I had picked up this duo of Oriflame Very Me eye pencil and eye shadow almost an year back and they turned out to be my most travel friendly products. I love the shades and the finish that I had to share these with you,

The packaging is really cute, the eyeshadow comes in a transparent case with a zipper print which is very attractive, and the pencil can easily be identified with the colors on the pencil and a cap on both ends.

These shades are perfect for both day look as well as evening look.

<strong>Day Look -</strong> I go with a in lined eyes with brown pencil or slight smudged brown pencil

<strong>Evening Look -</strong> A hint of eyeshadow on the eyes and lined with the golden liner<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Oriflame-Very-me-eyeshadow-and-eyepencil-3.jpg">

<strong>About Oriflame Very Me Eye Envy Shadow</strong> - The eyeshadow is nicely pigmented, but does not last long on my oily lids without a primer. The eyeshadow is very finely milled and has absolutely no fall out. With primer these last me good 5-6 hours without fading...

I would definitely suggest you pick up a few shades, these will be your budget best friend on travel.

<strong>About Very Me Double Trouble Eye Pencil -</strong> Its creamy, pigmented and the texture is lovely. Since these are the size of a writing pencil, its easy to sharpen too.

But these pencil won't show up on waterline. And mind you these are not as creamy as Colorbar or Faces cosmetics but still good enough.

I would definitely recommend these budget eye pencil.
