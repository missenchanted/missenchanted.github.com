<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi gals, there was a long pause in my blogging activities, I had some issues with my eyes and brains... as the doc says. But it was more of fatigue and long computer hours, also I was shifting to my own place, so much to do... shopping, packing, unpacking etc etc.. but I am back and no long pauses... pinky promise :) and pics coming up very soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I start with something fresh and organic... the Soulflower Lemon Ginger Immune Boost, its definitely Lemony with a hint of ginger. But its not meant for my skin.. but a great soap for people with oily skin.(<em>Why did I pick up, because I love colorful soaps and have to try them at any cost</em>)</p>
<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_7036.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4399" title="IMG_7036" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_7036.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.200</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Claims:</strong> We made hot lemon ginger tea, &amp; then decided to make it a soap! This immune booster soap is made up of all good things! Cleanses your body, improves skin tone.
<em>Used for clearing acne, cleaning greasy skin, as well as removing dead skin cells, easing  itching caused by insect bites and other skin eruptions. Suitable for oily to normal skin.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contains:</strong>  Lemon essential oil, fresh lemons &amp; ginger herb, turmeric powder, Vitamin E, glycerin, aqua, saponified oils of olive, coconut, castor, palm &amp; palm kernel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> If you have oily skin, specially acne prone then this soap is meant for you. It has mild lemon fragrance with slight hint of lemon, nothing strong and overpowering. Skin feels dry after use, and a heavy moisturizer is required for people with normal to dry skin. I don't use soap on face, so I can't say much about that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As this soap claims, so does it fulfills them. Go for it if you have acne prone oily skin. But if you are citrus crazy them no doubt the Lemon &amp; Satsuma range from TBS(<em>The body Shop</em>) are meant for you, they have an enchanting aroma, which lasts in you shower for hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Are you a citrus fan ?</strong></em></p>
