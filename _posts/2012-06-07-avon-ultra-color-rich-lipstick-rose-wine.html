<p style="text-align: justify;">My love for lip colors is increasing day by day, an year back I was more of a lip gloss person. I have come across some really good lipsticks in budget and Avon Ultra Color Rich Lipstick has to be counted with them. I love the beautiful texture most about them.</p>
<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.375 but most of the times they are on some offers sometimes even 40%

<strong>What it Claims:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>  Instantly releases rich color with creamy, sequined and shimmery finish that lasts for hours.</li>
	<li>  Non-bleeding/non feathering color defines and shapes lips even without a lip liner</li>
	<li>  Medium to full color.</li>
	<li>  Does not transfer to teeth</li>
	<li>  Tested by dermatologists</li>
</ul>

<strong>My Experience:</strong> These lipsticks are really creamy, not exactly melting like NYX ones. Give a smooth and satin finish, do not settle into fine line. Definitely non drying, but might bleed a little with dense lip balm underneath. Last me 2-3 hours, then starts to fade uniformly. Packaging is really good and sturdy.

I love this shade, this is such a beautiful rose shade which will suit almost all Indian skin tones, In my words its a must have.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Good pigmentation,</li>
	<li>I like the packaging, its sturdy and looks good,</li>
	<li>It gives a creamy and velvety finish similar to Colobar velvet range if you have tried them,</li>
	<li>Do not dry the lips,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I just wish it could stay a bit longer than 2-3 hours on me,</li>
	<li>Available only through Avon representatives,</li>
</ol>

I liked this lipstick, and surely going to add a few more colors. They are creamy, pigmented and non drying. Only thing they score less is the lasting power, which can be improved using lip base and lip liners. Will do a post soon about that.

Will totally recommend these if you are looking for moisturizing lip colors with beautiful finish, and lasting power is not much an issue.
