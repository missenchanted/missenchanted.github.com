Lips are no doubt the most delicate skin, and need constant care like a baby. I am a lip balm addict and have tried almost every one of those I could get my hands on. I have been using Nature's Co. Lip Chocolate-Mint lip balm for quite sometime now.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Moisturizes aptly and sufficient for dry and chapped lips(Winter is here)</li>
	<li>Packaging is cute, classy and stylish. You can't get your eyes off it for the first time.</li>
	<li>Although it's texture gives an impression, to be hard, but once you scoop out, it melts on the lips,</li>
	<li>Loved the fragrance, chocolate.... yummy :)</li>
	<li>All natural ingredients, environment friendly and cruelty free :)</li>
	<li>Staying power is average, around 2 hours which is quite ok.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Although its Chocolate-mint, but mint flavor is very subtle and gets lost in Chocolate,</li>
	<li>Availability is an issue, I wish they tie up with so many e-commerce websites out there,</li>
	<li>Tub packaging brings the messy task of taking out the balm :(</li>
</ol>

I just love the fragrance, it instantly lifts up my spirits, and melts like butter on my lips. Will definitely purchase this again.
