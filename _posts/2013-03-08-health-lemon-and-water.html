<h4>Health: Lemon and Water</h4>
<blockquote>Promise of  a new and healthy lifestyle**</blockquote>
Long working hours and lack of proper diet and excercise has left me completely exhausted and tired. After 10 hours of continous office followed by travel, blogging and housekeeping has taken a toll on my  health. I was growing ambitious with the blog and ended up spending 15-16 hours on an average in front of laptop for the last two months.

My Neck and body had been alerting me for a very long time, but this time they gave up. I have promised myself to lead a more healthy life and thus blogging has taken a back seat. This series of posts would be my journey to a better and healthy lifestyle.

First healthy step would be to start our mornings with something healthy, like some warm lemon water to kick start digestion process. That means a big NO to morning tea and coffee,

<strong>Recipe:</strong> Just take a thin slice of lemon in some luke warm water.
