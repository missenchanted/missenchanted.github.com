Sure I have been missing blogging since last couple of days... but my folks have come down for the first time for our house warming ceremony, so a lot of action behind the screen. As I am compiling this post, I look up to right corner to check time as I have to leave for Mysore at 5 am (<em>Will share the pics</em>)

Long story short.. I have been using Oriflame pure skin deep action clearing mask for over a month now, and its high time I wrote something about it(<em>Else I will definitely forget</em>). Oriflame clearing mask was introduced in last month's brochure and I bought it for some introductory offer,

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 299 for 50gm

<strong>Oriflame says</strong> Deep Action Mask with antimicrobial Salicylic acid and Detect Technology to reduce and prevent blackheads and spots. Purifies and tightens pores, and controls shine. Use 1-2 times per week.

I do not have any black/white heads.. yup lucky me, touchwood ... being an oily its difficult to stay away from breakouts and black heads. Then why did I pick up this mask, because I could notice few enlarged pores on my cheeks and I assumed since this can be a solution.

It comes in a very handy and travel friendly tube packaging. The mask looks and feels like some sort of tooth paste(Particularly the white Colgate one) and feels very cold on application. Imagine putting Colgate on your face... have you tried that ever ? I want to try at least once, silly me.

Did it solve my pore issues, no it did not. I actually cannot feel any difference after using this for last four weeks.

Can't say much about the blackhead clearing claim, but it does feels very cool on application and leave behind a clean feeling on the face, which I can attribute to Salicylic acid.
