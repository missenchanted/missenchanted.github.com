<p style="text-align: justify;">Again one more product from my December Enchantess bag(<a href="http://missenchanted.com/enchantess-beauty-samples-december-edition/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Read here</strong></em></a>). During my college days I had given Biotique and Shanaz Hussain products a lot of try since they were notoriously know for their herbal and natural ingredients. But sadly none of the products ever worked for me. Biotique Shampoos and conditioners made my hair hay like and soaps left me with super dry skin. And that's when my odyssey with both the ranges came to an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Biotique-Bio-Almond-overnight-therapy-lip-balm-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5474" title="Biotique Bio Almond overnight therapy lip balm 1" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Biotique-Bio-Almond-overnight-therapy-lip-balm-1.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 99</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I received this product in enchantess bag, I was not a happy person. But my perception changed when I used this lip balm. Its quite effective on dry lips but has its long its of pros and cons.
I find it very similar to <a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-lip-service/" target="_blank"><em><strong>LUSH Lip service</strong></em></a>, which costs six times this one.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Biotique-Bio-Almond-overnight-therapy-lip-balm-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5475" title="Biotique Bio Almond overnight therapy lip balm 2" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Biotique-Bio-Almond-overnight-therapy-lip-balm-2.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>Packaging is very plain and cheap, and not at all sturdy. It has started to damage the balm bullet from the very first day. Balm has a very waxy and not at all pleasing smell. Since its quite waxy, it feels heavy on the lips. Also I did not understand the inclusion of shimmer particles since its a overnight balm right ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Biotique-Bio-Almond-overnight-therapy-lip-balm-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5476" title="Biotique Bio Almond overnight therapy lip balm 3" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Biotique-Bio-Almond-overnight-therapy-lip-balm-3.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>Its totally natural if you see the ingredients. When applied at night, it survives till morning and you can still feel it on your lips. But it fulfills what it promises and gives proper care needed specially during winters.
I am not going to purchase this again, since we have so many better options in the same price range. But if you are looking for something safe and natural then you can surely give this a try.</p>
