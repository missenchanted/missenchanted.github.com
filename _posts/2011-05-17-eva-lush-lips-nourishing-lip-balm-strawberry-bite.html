<strong>EVA Lush Lips Nourishing Lip Balm Strawberry Bite</strong>

I always carry a pile of lip balms with me, I love they are so cute and smell good. I had never used tinted balm except TBS Satsuma Lip Balm which has glitter(review later). On my last visit to health and glow I picked up this balm, just for its cute packing.

Price: Rs. 60 for 8 gm

Product boasts of: Candylicious care for your lovely lips. With SPF 15 for sun protection, almond oil to moisturize and vitamin E to enrich, it leaves your lips inviting, berry-red and sweet.

Product contains: Octyl methoxycinnamate, Benzophenone 3, Beeswax, Jojoba oil, Sweet Almond oil, Tocopheryl Acetate(Vitamin E)

None of the ingredient looks scary

My experience: It has a sweet fragrance and taste :P. Gives nice tint to my lips.

What I like:
<ol>
	<li>Available inÂ  Classic vanilla, Tangy orange, Blackcurrant burst and Plum sparkle.</li>
	<li>SP15 included.</li>
	<li>Pleases fragrance and taste.</li>
	<li>Attractive and cute sliding pack.</li>
	<li>I liked the red tint it gives to the Lips.</li>
</ol>
What I did not like:
<ol>
	<li>Application of balm is bit messy, you end up getting a red tint on your fingers and need to be washed.</li>
	<li>Not quite hygienic I would add.</li>
	<li>No use for Dry and chapped lips, very less moisturization</li>
</ol>
My Verdict: I liked the product, but will I buy it again maybe. I am quite happy with my Nivea, Nuetregena balms. But I might give other variants a try for fun.
