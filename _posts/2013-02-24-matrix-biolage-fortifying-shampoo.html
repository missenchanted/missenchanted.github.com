<h4>Matrix Biolage Fortifying Shampoo review</h4>
Matrix Biolage shampoo strengthens and helps reconstruct damaged, chemically-treated or coarse hair. It helps defend against future breakage and leaves the hair strengthened, smooth, soft and shiny.

<strong>My take on the matrix shampoo: </strong>

A shampoo is one product which never satisfies my needs and I keep looking out for newer and better options always. Being quite a named brand in the market for hair care products, Matrix was the next brand I thought of trying couple of months ago. After reading the product description of each variant available at that time, I bought this Fortifying shampoo from the brand.

I am blessed with normal hair that behaves well tamed but I always face the issue of hair fall and dandruff every now and then. Matrix Biolage Fortifying shampoo claims to be a strengthening shampoo that treats damaged hair and makes them resilient, soft and shiny. This was the very reason I purchased it as I wanted something to control my hair fall.

This shampoo comes in a white sturdy bottle with a well-fitted flap lid. The shampoo is a white colored semi thick liquid with a pleasant aroma. It lathers very well and a small quantity is enough for a 1-time wash. The hair seems to have a nice shine after wash.

It effectively cleans the scalp from dirt and the flakiness seems to subside too for 2 days. But it would not make your dandruff go (actually it does not even claim to do that).

About controlling the hair fall, it does seem to work on that issue just right. The shampoo does reduce hair fall. It may not stop but the effect seen is noticeable. Just that the effect on the hair fall can be seen after 3-4 washes only so you need to be patient in that area.

I generally skip a conditioner or apply very less as my hair tends to get oily within 3 days so I prefer using a mild serum later on only on the length of the hair. But this shampoo is mild enough on the hair and does not leave them to dry or frizzy. But if you have dry/frizzy hair then better use a conditioner afterward as you cannot skip 1 with this.

Overall, it is a decent product. Nothing too great about it. If you face a general hair fall problem then you may use this as an alternative.

<strong>Ratings: 3.5/5</strong>
