<h3 style="text-align: center;">Travel is more than the seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas of living.Â  -Miriam Beard</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It took me 4 months, lots of Googling, and some amount of cash to plan our first international trip together to the heart of Asia, Malaysia. I had some apprehensions, since everything was planned by us from Air ticket to resorts at different places, but this trip turned out to be the best of my life. We got an opportunity to visit some pristine beaches, interact with people of various nationalities and experience a new culture and lifestyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2111.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2901" title="IMG_2111" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2111-600x400.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whenever we met any stranger, the first thing that strikes us is his/her personality and attitude towards life. Those smiling eyes, and warm greetings tell stories of the distance traveled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first phase of travel started from <em><strong>Kuala Terranganu</strong></em> (<em><strong>Redang</strong></em> and <em><strong>Perehentian Islands</strong></em>)
Redang and Perehentian islands are hidden gems in the Indian Ocean, a part of heaven I am sure. Crystal clear water, pristine white sand beaches, beautiful and colorful under water life. We stayed at a diving resort with complimentary snorkeling, that was like icing on the cake. This leg of the journey was more about relaxation and admiring the beauty of nature. But what stood most out of it, were the kids on the journey. I loved the confidence these kids carried on their sleeves, bringing to shame any adult attitude. The beautiful manners and daring outlook took my heart away. We as adults found ourselves really bad swimmers and managed to get cuts by the coral. But the kids went over the board, great depths, and even greater smiles. We Indians always try to put the kids in a cocoon of safety and comfort. We don't expect them to take risks and curb a part of their creativity that is not yet developed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_13912.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2908" title="IMG_13912" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_13912.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three days of amazing Redang we took a boat to Perhentians island shared by few couples and a Russian family. The family had a small baby girl, I expect her to be less than a year old. The peace and calm I could see on her face, when the boat was fighting with the high waves was commendable. there were moments where my heart would skip a beat in a water roller coaster, you you could see a constant smile her face. I love the way the parents expose their kids to the actual world but still keep their real culture alive in their hearts. We should make some notes and learn that forcible teaching culture and religion gives birth to rebels, we need to open our arms to learn from the worlds yet honestly educate ourselves about our culture and religion in our hearts.</p>

<div>Second phase: <em><strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong></em></div>
<div>I was taken aback by the high rising building, such diverse culture and amalgamation of Malay, Tamil and Chinese. We chucked the idea of taking tour operator around the city and decided to hop onto Malaysian rail. In three days we walked around 30 km, and by the end our journey we were totally numb, not because of walking but because of this beautiful country, which we wanted to explore more. I loved their lifestyle, night life, shopping options and their <strong>respect for women, which we lack the most in India</strong>. Although Malaysia is a Muslim country, but I think every nation should take lessons from them on how to become secular, accept different cultures and bring about an era of growth and prosperity.</div>
