<h4>Safe Haven Nicholas Sparks</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Love hurts. There is nothing as painful as heartbreak. But in order to learn to love again you must learn to trust again. When a mysterious…</strong></em></p>
I like the way Nicholas Sparks narrates his story. The romance seems so real, the characters build on you and you just start relating to them. This is my second novel from Nicholas Sparks in two weeks, earlier being <strong><a href="http://missenchanted.com/nicholas-sparks-dear-john/" target="_blank">Dear John</a></strong>

Safe Haven is a story around a lady protagonist. Katie who has a troubled and secretive past. Meets Alex and falls in love. The story is nothing new, I have heard it many a time, infact we have a very famous Bollywood movie on same lines(<em>Cant take name here, as it might spoil your read</em>)

Its a story about courage, will power and true love.

Nicholas Sparks makes me fall in love every time I pick up a read. I have read 5 books from his collection, and each of them had a unique way of story telling. But all of them shared the same love definition and warmth.

Nicholas Sparks Safe Haven is a very light and fast read. I finished it  easily over a weekend.

I clicked some interesting snippets from the book for you. Do pick up this book if you loves Nicholas sparks way of writing and love is something on your mind right now.

The year 2013 will see this book hitting the Hollywood big screens very soon.
