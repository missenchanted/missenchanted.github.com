<strong>Packaging:</strong> Comes in an airtight Aluminum foil, with complete list of ingredients and details mentioned on it. As the face mask needs to be stored in a cool place free from humidity, I transferred the content to a tin container and store it in my refrigerator.

<strong>How to use:</strong> Prepare mask by mixing with water/pure Rose water/Aloe Vera gel into a paste. Apply on face and neck. For daily use, leave on for 5 minutes. For weekly deep cleansing treatments, apply about one-quarter inch thick and leave on the skin for 20 minutes. Then remove the paste with a cool water rinse, to which you could add a little lemon juice or rose water. Moisturize.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> The Face mask powder smells completely herbal with Karpoora(Camphor) smell slightly overpowering the others. I mix rosewater with a teaspoon of powder. I prefer to leave the mixture aside for another 5 minutes so that powder soaks up all the rose water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the pace pack very cooling and soothing to the skin. It cools down the face a little. A thin layer dries up in 5 minutes, whereas a thick coat can take upto 30 minutes. It does not stretch or dry up the skin after wash. The H<em>aldi(turmeric)</em> content does give a slight yellowish/brownish color to the skin. So I prefer using a face wash after this and then tone and moiturize my face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been using this every alternate day for last 2 weeks. I cant see much difference on my skin though in terms of blemishes. But I am happy with Omved's Clear Skin Mask for firstly its <em>completely natural and free of any chemicals</em>, secondly <em>I like the way it soothes and cools my face</em> which does bring down the complete day's stress.
I like the herbal smell, its like having the Havan samagari on your face.</p>

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Completely natural and safe,</li>
	<li>Free from harmful chemicals,</li>
	<li>Smells herbal and soothes my senses,</li>
	<li>Did not break me out,</li>
	<li>Does control oil for my skin</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Will not show immediate results, you have to be pateient and dedicated,</li>
	<li>I would prefer if this came in a container rather than a pack, as it needs to be stored air tight and away from light.</li>
</ol>
I would definately recommend Omved clear skin pack, its economical, completely natural and safe.
