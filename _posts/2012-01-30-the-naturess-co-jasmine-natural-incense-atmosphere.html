Nothing feels better than an early morning, initiated with thankfulness to god and good thoughts for the future. We remember to say thanks and ask for more(Greedy me)... in various ways, but the most common of all would have to be a diya bati and incense sticks. I recently started using Nature's Co Jasmine Natural Incense, and it totally lives upto its expectations.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 75 for 32gm (30 sticks)

<strong>My Experience:</strong> These incense sticks smell great (Can't exactly trace Jasmine fragrance though), and make up my day in the morning :). Although I feel these are a bit highly priced, for the quantity provided and aren't so easily available.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Nature's co is an Indian brand,  and I feel proud when Indian companies bring out such strong and good products,</li>
	<li>Smells great,</li>
	<li>Lasts around 30 min, which is quite ok,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I felt these are bit overpriced,</li>
	<li>Not easily available, you can buy online from <a href="http://www.thenaturesco.com">here</a></li>
</ol>

<em><strong>Nature's co has come up with their first outlet in Bangalore finally, Phoenix Marketcity Mahadevpura, which is like a stone throw away from my place..... Lucky me :)</strong></em>
