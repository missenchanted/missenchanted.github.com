<h4>Maybelline Eyestudio Vivid &amp; Smooth liner in Peacock Green</h4>
I am hooked to colored pencils these days, pouncing on every possible brand and color. The peacock green shade was definitely not from my category of taste. Yet, I wanted Maybelline Eyestudio Vivid &amp; Smooth liner in Peacock Green shade since I had never tried anything so fluorescent. And I had my share of doubts, if my fair skin would adjust to this color. And yes, some how, to some extent it made me happy; though not 100% satisfactory.

The usual school crayon pencil is the look of the eyeliner. A black pencil with colored tip, exactly like those coloring pencil. A transparent plastic cap to shut it close is provided too.

The eyeliner is amazingly creamy and glides so easily without any trouble. The flash of color comes on the lash line in just one swipe. Habitually I do couple of more swipes.

The eyeliner does not smudge or bleed around my eyes. It stays for more than 8 hours. It tends to fade a little but it does not mess around. The shade has a shimmery texture blended in it. I do not find separate shimmers in its texture though. The bright green is as though the flash light is always in its focus. The green keeps emitting light.

This shade might not work well for dark skinned beauties. (Not sure, just my notion.) Yes, I like its texture a lot and the gliding factor too. I wish this peacock green was a bottle green instead. (I am mentioning bottle green every time in my post. So sorry.)

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Gliding factor.</li>
	<li>Creamy texture.</li>
	<li>Stays on lash line for a good 8 hours.</li>
	<li>Mess free application.</li>
	<li>No smudging and bleeding.</li>
	<li>More shade selection available from this range.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I don’t like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The shade Peacock Green.</li>
</ol>
I am rating this 3.5 because of this peacock green shade which is not my taste. Had it not been for the shade taste, I would have definitely rated this pencil 4.5.

<strong>Rating:</strong> 3.5/5
