<p style="text-align: justify;">One look and this LUSH sea vegetable soap will remind you of mint and give a summer feel about it. But don't judge it this with the looks, its meant to be all about ocean feel and fragrance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LUSH-Sea-Vegetable-Soap.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5350" title="LUSH Sea Vegetable Soap" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LUSH-Sea-Vegetable-Soap.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.320 for 100gm</p>
<strong>The Claim:</strong> A refreshing splash in the ocean. Sea Vegetable is made with seaweed, one of our favorite ingredients, with a crust of stimulating sea salt to give your body a good scrub down. It smells of lime, lavender and seaweed, a bit like sitting at the beach next to someone applying suntan lotion. This is a great soap for sharing amongst the whole household. The scent is perfectly balanced for boys and girls everywhere.
<!--more-->Definitely handsome looking but pricey soap from LUSH. Did it impress me, I would straight away say a NO. Its quite an average soap with good looks to be called a sea weed/vegetable soap.Â  Fragrance wise it does smell a little sea weed and in a good way.
This soap tends to crumble specially a part of it which has sea weed and gets wasted a lot. Lathers mildly and cleans but does not moisturize my skin in even mild winter of Bangalore.

I would not pick up this soap again, just for the price tag as its bit pricey for what the soap has to offer. LUSH is sometimes such a big HIT for me and sometimes a big DUD and this one goes into the later list.</p>
<em><strong>Which is your favorite LUSH soap ?</strong></em>
