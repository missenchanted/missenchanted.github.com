You dig into a girl's bag, and you will always find that sheer gloss sitting in one corner. Its a must in every bag. I just happen to pick this color just because of its sheer nature.

Price: Rs. 199 bought @ Health and glow.

Color: Rose pink but its very sheer.

Pros:
<ol>
	<li>Because of color it gives natural look to the lips,</li>
	<li>Price is quite low,</li>
	<li>Color variety (<a title="Maybeline color range" href="http://www.maybelline.com/products/19/lips/lip-gloss/color-sensational-lip-gloss/pink-perfection/035?shadeId=146" target="_blank">http://www.maybelline.com/products/19/lips/lip-gloss/color-sensational-lip-gloss/pink-perfection/035?shadeId=146</a>),</li>
	<li>Great for everyday use, gives that moisture to the lips,</li>
	<li>Can be used over other color lipsticks, works as a general gloss,</li>
	<li>Easily available</li>
</ol>

</ol>
