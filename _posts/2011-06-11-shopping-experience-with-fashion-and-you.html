<p style="text-align: justify;">I got hooked to online shopping an year back and the first of the few websites were Fashion and You, and 99labels. My first purchase on FnY was on 29th April, 2010 and last on 8th October, 2010. Online shopping can be quite addictive, even if you have no requirements, you always login at the time sales start and browse through all unneeded items, and by the time you know you have already made your first impulsive purchase. Then you sit and wait, wait and call, call and sit.. thats what you do with FnY for a months or maybe months :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/beta.thumbalizr.com_.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-589" title="beta.thumbalizr.com" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/beta.thumbalizr.com_-300x240.png" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although they have great sales, that flash your Computer screen and compel you to buy them, their credit policy is also hassle free, I always got my points on time and redeemed them without any issues. But once I received my parcels, i never found myself quite satisfied, firstly because of all those customer call to track the order, secondly and most importantly the product never turns out that good, as it looks on site, fabric never has that glow, shoes don't have those shine and accessories look like left overs of a clearance sale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A word of advice to FnY, they desperately need to upgrade their customer service and check the stocks received from vendors before shipping out. Most of my friends whom i invited have some real bad experience of receiving wrong parcels, or undervalued items :(</p>

</a>I have moved on now from FnY, lately I have made some purchases on Tradus and its has been quite a shopping experience :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[important]I have shopped thrice after this review, the shipping time remains the same, butÂ  shipping and customer experience has improved a lot since then[/important]</p>
