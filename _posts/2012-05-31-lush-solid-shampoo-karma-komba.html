<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever wondered or got fascinated by princess stories, where a helper would dry her hair using smoke and aroma oils. I bet no one has the time to do so these days ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been using the <a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-jumping-juniper-solid-shampoo-bar/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">LUSH Jumping Juniper</span></a>, this time I wanted a change and picked up this beautiful piece of green soap which just looked lovely. SA told me its meant for oily scalp and the <a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-karma-soap-review/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Karma</span></a> name was enough to entice me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_6704.jpg"><img title="IMG_6704" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_6704.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Price:</strong> Rs. 620</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong> Patchouli and citrus bar to perfume and detangle</strong></em></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Start your day with good Karma and great hair with every wash with our happy hippy solid shampoo bar. It gently cleans your hair, and scents your locks with our signature Karma fragrance. In addition to the groovy mood it leaves you in, essential oils of orange, pine, and patchouli keep your scalp soothed and toned. And for those who suffer from knotty hair, the oils in Karma have a beneficial side effect of smoothing hair, allowing you to brush through it without pulling your hair out. Considering that our solid shampoo bars last longer that most relationships, this is very good Karma indeed. Lather up!</div>

<strong> My experience:</strong> Its does pretty good job of controlling oil on the scalp, and leaves behind a beautiful scent. One piece of soap last me 4-5 months, which is quite good. It leaves my washroom with a beautiful smell for a long time. But it does dry up my hair ends, for that I just apply the soap on the scalp alone, and let the foam wash down and use a really good moisturizer.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Does control oil on the scalp, and gives volume</li>
	<li>Gives a beautiful smell that lasts for sometime,</li>
	<li>Its LUSH, so it has to be all natural,</li>
	<li>Solid shampoos are travel friendly,</li>
	<li>Last me 4-5 months, that's really good.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>It dries up my hair ends, which are already dry</li>
</ol>
I completely love this soap, its a good alternative for Jumping juniper. Makes me feel like a princess with those voluminous locks and lovely fragrance.

Note: I use the shampoo tins only for travel purpose , else the bar becomes all gooey and lot of it gets wasted. After use dry it up on a ceramic plate.

<em><strong>Which color soap would you like ?</strong></em>
