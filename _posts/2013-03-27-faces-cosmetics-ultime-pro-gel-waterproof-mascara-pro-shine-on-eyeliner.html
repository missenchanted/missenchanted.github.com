<h4>Faces Cosmetics Ultime Pro Gel Waterproof Mascara &amp; Pro Shine on Eyeliner</h4>
<blockquote>Faces Cosmetics Ultime Pro Gel Waterproof Mascara Review</blockquote>
For me Kohl and Black Mascara is a religion. I can never step out of my house without them. I am sure many of you would agree that nothing can bring a spark to your eyes more than a good liner and a mascara.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Gel-Waterproof-Mascara-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8134" alt="Faces Cosmetics Ultime Pro Gel Waterproof Mascara 1" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Gel-Waterproof-Mascara-1.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Claim:</strong> Smear, smudge and sweat proof. Lasts up to 24 hours. Contains conditioning ingredients that nourish. Gives a stunning lengthening and curling definition, without clumping.

Ultime Pro Gel Waterproof Mascara comes in a sleek but relatively longer tube, with a flexible wand and a larger brush. One swipe of the brush is enough to cover the entire lash.

This mascara gives a lengthening effect to the lashes and defines them without any clumping or flaking. But don't expect any volume out of it. The mascara dries up really fast so you have to be quick while applying coats. Its waterproof, so will work great even when we splash our eyes with water. Its easy to remove to. I use Biotique Almond Oil on a cotton and gentle rub the lashes. You don't need much hard work while removing.<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Gel-Waterproof-Mascara-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8136" alt="Faces Cosmetics Ultime Pro Gel Waterproof Mascara 3" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Gel-Waterproof-Mascara-3.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong><!--more-->What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Sleek packaging, longer wand and an adequate brush,</li>
	<li>Its waterproof and smudge proof,</li>
	<li>Easy to remove,</li>
	<li>Dries up very quickly,</li>
	<li>Lengthen the lashes and defines them without clumping and flaking,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>7.5ml is too much for a mascara which is supposed to be discarded every 3 months.</li>
</ol>
I might buy again if they launch in smaller tube and quantity. Even if I use daily its hard to finish off in 3-4 months. Apart from that I would recommend this if you are looking for a waterproof and lengthening Mascara.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Shine-on-Eyeliner-Moonlit-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8138" alt="Faces Cosmetics Ultime Pro Shine on Eyeliner Moonlit" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Shine-on-Eyeliner-Moonlit-2.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.699

<strong>Claim: </strong>Extraordinary color to make you shine! Gives a long lasting and intense shiny finish. Comes with a felt tip for precise application. Exquisitely lush and quick drying. Totally water and smudge proof.

Available in two shades - <em>Moonlit</em> &amp; <em>Emerald Dazzle</em>
<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Shine-on-Eyeliner-Moonlit-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8140" alt="Faces Cosmetics Ultime Pro Shine on Eyeliner Moonlit 4" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Shine-on-Eyeliner-Moonlit-4.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

No doubt the color is very beautiful and vibrant. Its a must shade for evening looks. Like the Ultime Pro Gel Waterproof Mascara this one also is gifted with a longer wand and gives a good grip for application.

I am not a felt tip fan though. Felt tip has its own issues, they dont gives a uniform line plus leave a groove like line and need to to retouched. I prefer to use my own eye liner brush for same. If I splash some water and rub it off, the eye liner comes off in peels. So its not smudge proof when wet.<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Shine-on-Eyeliner-Moonlit-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8141" alt="Faces Cosmetics Ultime Pro Shine on Eyeliner Moonlit 6" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Faces-Cosmetics-Ultime-Pro-Shine-on-Eyeliner-Moonlit-6.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

I would recommend this eyeliner only if you are comfortable with the felt tip or don't mind using a separate eye brush for same.
