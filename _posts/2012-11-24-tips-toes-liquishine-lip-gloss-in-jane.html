I recently got my hands on my first Tips &amp; Toes Gloss from the Liquishine range in Jane. It was quite funny when I opened the tube for first time....he he now you have to read on,

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7347.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5072" title="IMG_7347" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7347.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 375 for 3 gm

Ok coming to the funny part, when I opened the tube for the first time the wand got stuck inside... the applicator width is more than tube opening and you have to really wrestle to get it out(<em>Maybe its just a faulty tube</em>). Story from there has been quite smooth.

The formula is creamy and smells weird and my nose doesn't like that.

Its not drying at all, and stays for 2-3 hours without meals but survives the drinks and coffee in between. Its beautifully pigmented and gives a great coverage, one can totally skin lip color and move onto this after balm.

Color is a beautiful pink with hint of shimmer and looks frosty. This is a color which will suite all skin tones.

Liquishine lip gloss is a good pick if you are looking for pigmented gloss and color, but Tips and toes really needs to improve on the packaging and please remove that weird smell.. something like fruity will definitely do for us.
