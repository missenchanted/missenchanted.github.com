I was using olive oil as a replacement since quite long, its a terrific way to remove makeup. Lately I have been using long lasting colors and waterproof mascara and olive oil failed in removing them, oil left me with smokey eyes ;) and had to rub cotton s many times on the mascara that it left me with burning and irritated eyes :(

Picked up this product about three weeks back and have been using it since then..
