<p style="text-align: justify;">LUSH has been my all time favorite brand for skin care, but recently I have been hitting dud products with them, first came the <a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-celebrate-lip-tint/">Celebrate lip tint</a> and then <a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-australian-igloo-sugar-scrub/">Australian Igloo scrub</a>. I happen to pick up Angel's delight soap from LUSH online store at 50% off as post Christmas offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Angel_s_Delight_4f02a61abdd68.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2523" title="Angel_s_Delight_4f02a61abdd68" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Angel_s_Delight_4f02a61abdd68.png" width="475" height="430" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.295 for 100gm</p>
<strong>LUSH says:</strong> A soap that is bursting with colour and a sweet fruity smell. One of our Christmas bestsellers that returns year after year, by popular demand. A huge golden man on the moon sits atop this soap and wraps around a huge pink block of soap, with more decorations than a Christmas tree. With random blocks of colours, silver glitter, gold glitter, iridescent glitter and a lovely gold lustre, you never know just what your slice is going to look like. But what you do know is that you’ll get a soap that is universally appealing, with sweet orange essential oil, tangerine oil and a fruity fragrance. It brings a little bit of summer sunshine into the winter and makes you feel like you’ve been visited by angels. If you want a stunning centrepiece to your family Christmas, then why not phone us to ask about the price of a whole block.

<strong>My Experiece:</strong> I had an experience of soap melting and evaporation with My <a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-karma-soap-review/">LUSH Karma</a> earlier, so this time I sliced the soap into several pieces :)
This is a very glittery and colorful soap, I got the cream and blue part of it. It smells good like any other LUSH soap. My only concern with the product is that it doesnt lather much, no foam at all, and neither is it very moisturizing although its neither very dying. Ok I dont want to confuse you any more :P straight to pros and cons,

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Very colorful soap, an eye candy,</li>
	<li>Smells quite good, but its doesn't linger on the skin for long</li>
	<li>Not drying</li>
	<li>Unlike many other LUSH soaps, this one does not melt on the dish :)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Doesn't lather, at least the part of soap that I received,</li>
	<li>Since it doesn't claim much I at least expected it to be moisturizing, which it isn't :(</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are some great LUSH soaps out there, but this isn't one of them. Its more of a fun and celebration oriented soap with the colors and smells. But for skin care this doesn't deliver much. I won't be picking this up again :(</p>
