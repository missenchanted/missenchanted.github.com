<h4>Avon Simply Pretty Metallic Liquid Eyeliner Copper Review &amp; Swatches</h4>
I keep popping up with one or the other colorful eyeliner, either liquid or pencil. It is now being obvious that I like colorful lines on my eyes. And here is another one that I tried, Avon Simply Pretty Metallic Liquid Eyeliner Copper

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Avon-Simply-Pretty-Metallic-Liquid-Eyeliner-Copper-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6816" title="Avon Simply Pretty Metallic Liquid Eyeliner Copper 1" alt="Avon Simply Pretty Metallic Liquid Eyeliner Copper" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Avon-Simply-Pretty-Metallic-Liquid-Eyeliner-Copper-1.jpg" width="900" height="675" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.149 for 3 ml

The whole structure of the eyeliner bottle in conical, both the bottle and the cap form a cone. The bottle shows the color of the liquid liner and cap is hard plastic in white color. The cap is very elongated which makes the application of the eyeliner easy and controlled. The felt tip applicator attached to the the cap is not very long though. The felt tip is not stiff like the usual ones, its flexible and bends along when needed.

The shade is very silky copper. It will look very glamorous on some who has fair complexion. I have dark circles around my eyes, so it does not look as intense as it looks in my hand swatch. Yet I like sporting this shade of copper. I feel good as it is something different from the usual black. The product does not show anything shimmery. But I find the shimmers around my eyes when I wash/remove the eyeliner.

The hand swatch shows a <em>groove in the eyeliner application</em>. Did you notice that? and while applying on my upper lash line too, the applicator leaves that groove like formation.

<em><strong>How stupid.</strong></em> I will have to wait until the first application dries and again fill in that groove with some more eyeliner. This will leave uneven finish in my eyeliner application. Take a look at the image of my eye I have included. Not very noticeable though, but it is the question of quality and precision you see.

This is not long staying eyeliner. Somewhere around 4 hours and then it begins to fades away. A splash of water will remove off the eyeliner easily. No traces left behind too.

There is something important to speak more about this eyeliner. <em>Every time I use this on my upper lash line, I get teary eyes</em>. Hell why? Anybody with any idea!? Or is it only with me ? I do not bother about the groove or with the stay power; but I hate my watery eyes after I apply.
