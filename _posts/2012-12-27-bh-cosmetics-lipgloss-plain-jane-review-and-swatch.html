<p style="text-align: justify;">I prefer neutral and nude shades for office, since color will shout out loud at least in an office like mine. I got this gloss from Shalini, and quite like it for its texture and shade.</p>

This is a very sheer gloss, with a hint of natural tint. I use it mostly over my nude lip color and liners. The formula is very light and non sticky. I also like the brush applicator and would prefer it any day over dove foot applicators.

This one cannot survive the regular coffee breaks in between and would need touch ups.

I shall definitely pick up a few more beautiful shades from this range, but maybe not this color again. But gals who do not have pigmented lips can definitely give this a try when on sale.
