<h4>Nicholas Sparks The Guardian</h4>
<blockquote>The man of your dreams - or your worst nightmare.....</blockquote>
I am on a Nicholas Spark's read festival... and this would be like fourth or the fifth read from him in a row. The Guardian is a romantic thriller. Story is nothing new but presented well and I totally liked reading it.

The book is typically Nicholas Sparks, you read a page and you can easily identify his writing style. The characters are lively and lovable.

The books starts on a sad note... when Jim is dead and leaves behind a letter and a ugly puppy for his wife.. Julie.

Julie has always had a rough road in life, but she is gifted with really great and loving friends Mable, Emma,Henry and Mike. Adores her pet Singer who is the most important part of her life

<span>The chapters in the mid get a bit boring and repetitive... but the end is like a breeze full of thrill and faster story pace. The story takes a turn when Andrew enters Julie's life and she find him mysteriously charming.... But she has to decide between the charming stranger A<span>ndrew</span> and his best pal Mike...</span>

Whom did she choose in the end.. What turns her life upside down and who is her Guardian.. for this you need to pick up a copy of The Guardian.

Overall The Guardian is a good read, different from other Nicholas Sparks novels.

I am taking a slight break from romantic stories... yesterday I finished The Promise from Nikita Singh in a record three hour read...and I basically cleansed my tear ducts for roughly and hour... review coming up next.
