Christmas season may be over but left behind for us the LUSH 50% sale, and as any other LUSH maniac I too picked up most of it. Snowcake is not from the permanent range but comes around once a year,

<strong>LUSH says: </strong>This soft white soap smelling of marzipan and fruit has people rushing in to stock up as soon as we release our Christmas stock. We’d sell this all year, but then Christmas wouldn’t be so special. Made with a fragrance of rose absolute, cassis absolute and benzoin resin. The soft, white, rich foam of Snowcake is great for the bath and shower, but it also makes a great hand washing soap in basins around the house. Its smell resonates with the season and gives a festive feel to the whole house.

Sufficiently moisturizing, but need a body lotion after sometime. Does not melt like crazy like other LUSH soaps and that is a real plus point.

	<li>Not enough moisturizing for me,</li>

Hmm, I am not sure I am going to buy this again, did not find it enough moisturizing for my dry skin and I found it pricey for a soap.
