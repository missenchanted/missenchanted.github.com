<p style="text-align: justify;">Lavender, purple has to be the combination for me for that aromatic spa like experience for me. Purple foam and an aromatic washroom, is all that I had expected. Currently I am at my hometown, with temperatures going down, and how I am craving for a hot water bath….</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>LUSH Christmas eve bubble bar</strong></em> is a limited edition bar meant for Christmas festivities. Its a beautiful bar with a yellow moon. It has nice aromatic smell but its bar form I totally dislike because after its first usage it comes crumbling down. Worse is if you take steam bath.. this bar will join you too and soak up all the moisture. So I just powdered the entire stuff and stored it in a jar. It gives lovely bubbles and turns the water sort of grayish and not purple. Would totally recommend this.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Soulflower Lavender Bath Salt.</strong></em> The only thing I love about this is the beautiful purple color, but I am totally unimpressed. Their is no calming fragrance at all, neither does it give an aromatic fragrance to water. But it definitely helps in the scrubbing section. Since I have not tried many bath salts before I really cannot compare this. But I am surely not buying this again and will pick up something that's more fragrant.</p>
