<h3>Dove Hair Therapy Damage Solutions Intense Repair Shampoo</h3>
I love trying different hair care products. I bought Dove Hair Therapy Damage Solutions product for my entire family. I had the smaller version of this one and loved this so I bought this one.

<strong>Packaging:</strong> It has a pump packaging, which dispenses the correct amount of shampoo required.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 349 for 675ml

<strong>My Experience with Dove Hair Therapy Damage Solutions Intense Repair Shampoo with Fiber Actives:</strong>

I have been trying it since 2 weeks now and have mixed feelings about it. It makes my hair soft and silky but then, it dries them out. In addition it does nothing for split ends, dandruff, dryness, roughness and dullness. The Packaging is Bulky and not travel friendly but smaller versions of this are available too. It is a slightly runny and shimmery liquid which contains SLS and a whole lot of other chemicals. However, my Hubby loves it as it makes his hair soft. It actually does nothing miraculous and just cleanses the hair properly leaving it dry and clean. I am sure I will find better shampoos at better prices, which will work better than this.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Makes hair soft and silky</li>
	<li>Cleans the hair properly</li>
	<li>Pump Packaging</li>
	<li>Quantity</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>SLS and other chemicals’ content</li>
	<li>Does nothing for dryness, dullness, dandruff, split ends, etc</li>
	<li>Does not control hair fall at all</li>
	<li>Effects are very temporary</li>
</ul>
<strong>Verdict:</strong> This is a regular shampoo and most of its claims are false.  I mean I have been using it for 2 weeks and have seen nothing except for slight softness. Therefore, this does not work at least for me.

If you have very oily scalp and hair, you may try it but otherwise neither would I recommend this nor would I repurchase it.
