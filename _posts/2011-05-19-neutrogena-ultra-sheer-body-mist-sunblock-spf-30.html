<strong>Neutrogena ultra sheer body mist sunblock spf 30</strong>

Was out shopping for a new SPF, and luckily struck this body mist bottle. Found it quite amusing and handy. SPF is not for occasions, but a necessity. Harsh sun rays not only can tan, but can also cause skin cancer and premature aging.Even on cloudy day SPF is a must because of UV rays :(

Product boasts of: <a rel="attachment wp-att-93" href="http://missenchanted.com/neutrogena-ultra-sheer-body-mist-sunblock-spf-30/img_0719/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0719.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="288" /></a>

﻿Product contains: SD-Alcohol 40-2(68%), Isobutane, Diethexyl 2, 6-Napthalate, Trisiloxane, Dimethicone, Acrylates/Octylacrylamise copolymer, PPG-5-CETETH-20, Tocopheryl acetate, Ascorbyl palmitate, Retinyl palmitate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Acryalates/Dimethicone copolymer, Fragrance

The spray is such a useful concept you can spray everywhere with ease. Although you can put this on both face and body, you cannot spray directly to the face. Need to take some of it on your hands and pat it all over the face. I do not use regularly as i have a sedentary job, complete day under AC. For regular use I have Vaseline white body lotion. But on shopping days, beach surfing this spray is a life save﻿r, has never disappointed me ever.

What I like:
<ol>
	<li>Easy to spray on all parts.</li>
	<li>You don't feel sticky or heavy on your skin, as with other cream.</li>
	<li>Fragrance is acceptable</li>
	<li>Dries of so quickly, you don't have to massage it over</li>
	<li>Waterproof, but I still apply it when out of pool or sea water.</li>
	<li>Very effective, never got complain of tan or sunburns after its usage</li>
	<li>Hygienic packing and easy to carry without fear or tube break or bottle spill</li>
</ol>
What I didn't like
<ol>
	<li>Not mentioned on the pack if its tested on animals</li>
	<li>Leaves a glossy shimmer on the skin, but within 10-15 min this gets absorbed  into the skin and looks ok</li>
	<li>Cannot apply directly to the face</li>
	<li>Very high content of alcohol... 68% is like quite high.</li>
</ol>

My Verdict: If I get to know this product is tested on animal, Neutrogena is off my list. Else this product is all praiseworthy and will surely buy next can

Ladies SPF is  a must... a must... must :)
