<p style="text-align: justify;">It feels so sad when a product just doesn't live up to even half the expectations. I have had a good streak with Aroma Magic and I usually recommend them to all my friends, but this particular product is the second flop from the brand... the first one was some Aroma Magic Triphla Hair Lotion which was a total Dud (<em>Do you think I should review that</em>)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Claims:</strong> <strong>Aroma Magic Peppermint Exfoliating Gel</strong> reveals new, refreshed, glowing skin. The anti-aging AHA penetrates deep into dead skin cells, rubbing them off and revealing the new smooth and luminous skin. Peppermint with its great soothing and cooling effects cures the soreness of skin and exfoliates the intense blackheads. With no visible fine lines skin becomes toned and radiant. See the effects from the very first use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> It looks and feels so much like aloe vera gel, but colorless. I apply it for few min and when it feels less sticky I tried scrubbing action. But there isn't any granules or rough texture to provide scrubbing. Its a bit hard to remove, as this sticks to the skin....</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I would not recommend this, as it did nothing for my oily skin. No scrubbing action, no mask like properties. But this might turn out ok for dry skin during summers just to calm that heat. I am giving this a total pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Which is your favorite scrub ?</strong></em></p>
