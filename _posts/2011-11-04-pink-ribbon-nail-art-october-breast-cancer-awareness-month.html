I know I am quite late to upload this piece of nail art, since it did not turn out quite like I imagined. But in thought it was not about nail color, preciseness, or beautiful nails. This was a small way to express the concern over the alarming rate of cancer.

So ladies please be aware of this type of cancer, get yourself diagnosed once a year. May god bless everyone with a healthy and hearty life :)

Hidesign has also come up with a Pink Ribbon collection range. 20% of the price would go towards charity. And I so badly want the Laptop bag from the range :)
