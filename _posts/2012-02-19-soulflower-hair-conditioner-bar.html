<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently picked this solid conditioner as I wanted to try out something natural for my hair time, no more SLS and parabens. But this turned out to be a nightmare.. hmmm even more than that...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2917.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2799" title="IMG_2917" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2917.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.400.00</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2918.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2800" title="IMG_2918" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2918.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>How to use:</strong> Apply a small amount of conditioner to the hair and scalp &amp; gently massage in.Leave on for 10-15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly &amp; dry the hair.

I gave it a try again using minimal quantity but still same. Ok so third time I directly used this on my oiled hair followed by my usual conditioner. My hair felt squeaky clean and oil was removed oh yeah but they still had a weird texture.
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would also like to add here that my hair don't react well to home made reetha and shikakai also and this had a similiar effect on me. Now the question is how can a conditioner remove oil from my scalp, is it really a conditioner or this is a shampoo with a wrong name.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can anyone please tell me if I am using this the wrong way, else I am gonna use it as a shampoo for ultimately oiled hair :)</p>
I am not going to purchase this again, Condioner is such a misnomer word for this product, its reetha and shikakai or a shampoo :(
