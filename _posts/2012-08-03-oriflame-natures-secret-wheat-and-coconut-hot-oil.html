Friday evenings, chocolates in hand,cuddly movie on Star and a Hot Oil Massage. Hmmm perfect way to start a beautiful weekend. I grabbed up Oriflame Nature's secret Wheat and Coconut hot oil last month. Its a one time application and was enough for me to make up a mind about future purchase.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_6913.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4163" title="IMG_6913" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_6913.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 75 for 15ml

<strong>Claims:</strong>Â Nourishing treatment to soften and add shine to dry damaged hair. Place unopened tube in hot water for 1 minute, break open, massage into wet hair, leave in for 1 minute and rinse as usual.

<strong>My experience:</strong> Packagning and way of application is fancy enough, keep the tube in warm water. Twist the cap and voila clear but viscous liquid can be poured in a bowl for better application. Don't remember the fragrance but it felt quite like coconut cookie.

As the temperature falls the viscosity increases and the oil becomes more like gel. I did not enjoy my massage with this, it got cold very quickly and felt more like styling gel. I left it on for few minutes(1 min felt less) and then rinsed with slight warm water, but no difference at all instead it my hair a bit more frizzy. I cannot find any reason why it failed on me, also it felt very cold on the scalp.

I am not doing any pros about this product, it failed terribly on me. I find parachute oil far better but I love the Trichup Oil. Trichup Oil for dandruff worked wonders for my sis and she has almost NILL hair fall... she doesn't want to budge to another brands anymore.
