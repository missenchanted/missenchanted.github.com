<h4>Lakme Enrich Lipcolors Classics 352 Cherry</h4>
Today I am going to review the first ever lipstick I fell in love with and purchased. This is a bright True Red Lipstick from Lakme Enrich Lipcolors Classics. Lakme has always been famous with our mothers. So having grown up seeing Lakme lipsticks on my mummy’s shelf, it was unjustified not to fall in love with it.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 225

The packaging is decent and sturdy. The cap gets fit with a click sound. You can easily carry it in your handbag. The maroon winish color with sleek golden ring gives the bullet a very nice look.

The ingredient list is missing on the packaging. The lipstick is not too moisturizing but not drying either, In summers you can easily wear it without a lip balm.

Like all lakme lipsticks, it smells bubblegumish  but is not very much bothering. This is a deep red color with a creamy touch. This color is a perfect red. It is not bluish, orangish or pinkish. This is just the right red.

This color is certainly not for the faint hearted. It requires exfoliated lips, a nice lip liner, clean white teeth and oodles of confidence to carry this color. But believe me, once you wear this shade you are ready to rock the party. And you are sure to get those drool worthy and some enviable eyes too.

<strong>Remember whenever putting on a red lipstick:</strong>

• Always apply a <em>lip liner</em> as it defines you lips and gives a good canvas to fill the color. This particular lipstick is quite bleeding in nature. So I fill my lips with lip liner first, then apply the lipstick, press my lips with a tissue to blot the excess color, and apply the lipstick again. This makes my lipstick stay longer and prevents bleeding.

• Keep the rest of the makeup minimal. Coz you should always have just one statement asset in your makeup, be it eyes or lips. And anyways, after applying this color you will definitely not feel the need to put on anything (<em>it makes you look really very beautiful</em>)

• Your teeth should be white. If you have yellow teeth, then you should refrain from red lipstick as it makes them look even more yellow.

• Red looks best either creamy or matte. My personal taste doesn’t suggest me to top it on with a gloss. So to get that classic Marlin Monroe look, keep your lipstick gloss free.

<strong>Pros-</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Cheap and easily available.</li>
	<li>Beautiful Red.</li>
	<li>Sturdy and classy packaging.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Cons-</strong>
<ol>
	<li>It bleeds and is transferable.</li>
</ol>
Medium to fair skinned girls will rock it easily. Those who are shy to red lipstick may start applying it at home to build some confidence.
