<p style="text-align: justify;">I just heard from my parents that North India is almost frozen, I am lucky to be in a city with favorable conditions. I love you Bangalore. But I just got reminded of my winter holidays, when whole day was spent inside blanket and lovely mom making soup and tea the whole day. I just did not feel like taking bath, since it was too cold and the skin would feel so stretchy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If only there could be a <em>soap for winters</em>, touch the skin and it goes <em>warm</em> and <em>moisturizes</em> your skin so well that you don't need anything after that... but that's just a dream I think...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Soulflower-milk-cocobar-soap.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5275" title="Soulflower milk cocobar soap" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Soulflower-milk-cocobar-soap.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 200</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Claim:</strong> One of the mildest soaps that we make, this bar is 100% natural, containing nothing more than its title suggests. This is a favorite of our customers with extra-sensitive skin, eczema &amp; psoriasis. The Milk bar is also recommended for toddlers and children with sensitive skin.
Cocoa butter lays down a protective layer that holds moisture to the skin, making it a good skin softener &amp; Fresh Milk produces a gentle creamy soap.</p>
<strong>Ingredients:</strong>Fresh milk, Vitamin E, glycerin, aqua, cocoa butter, olive, rice bran, castor, coconut &amp; palm oil.

Now don't judge me.. I expect handmade natural soaps to be a bit jazzy and fun, don't you? Fragrance wise it has typical palm oil smell, which is also the case with many Soulflower soaps. Lathers really well and does moisturize the skin to an extent. But you still need a moisturizer once you are out of the bath.

Best thing about Soulflower soaps have to be that they do not melt like many other handmade soaps.

I was pretty confused to recommend this soap, but then since I wont be purchasing this again.. I would suggest to pick up <a href="http://missenchanted.com/soulflower-pink-for-skin-soap/" target="_blank">SoulFlower Pink For Skin Soap</a> if you are looking for moisturizing soap in winter and <a href="http://missenchanted.com/soulflower-charcoal-you-smell-good-soap/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Soulflower Charcoal You Smell Good Soap</span></a> if you are looking for a fresh feel soap in Summer.

<em><strong>Which is your favorite Soulflower soap ?</strong></em>
