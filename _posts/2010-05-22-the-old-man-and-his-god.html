<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Old Man And His God by Mrs. Sudha Murthy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yesterday I picked up  The Old Man And His God by Mrs. Sudha Murthy. She has brought together small stories and events that have inspired her throughout her journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Old-Man-And-His-God-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7047" alt="The Old Man And His God" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Old-Man-And-His-God-1.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
Book is a very light read, but not that light to your mind. Some of the stories will leave you thinking of quite sometime. Its not just a read but something to take back.

Its a collection of short stories, each story shall take 15-20 min to finish. So its ideal for people who don't have much reading time.

As a blogger I was inspired from <em>The Old Man And His God </em>that I decided to start this blog, to keep myself a record of events that I like talking about. I shall come back again to this post in my old age and remember the fondness with which the post was written.

<em><strong>Have you read The Old Man And His God ?</strong></em>
