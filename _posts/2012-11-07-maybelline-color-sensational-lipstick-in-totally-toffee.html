<p style="text-align: justify;">I just love the neutral shades when it comes to lip colors, as I can easily keep on hoarding them without any guilt since I know I shall be able to use them completely. Maybelline Color Sensational in Totally Toffee is the perfect MLBB(<em>My Lips but better</em>) shade for fair skin.A gift for those who have pigmented lips and are in search for a prefect everyday nude shade.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.299</p>

Unlike my <a href="http://missenchanted.com/colorbar-matte-lipstick-in-bare/" target="_blank">Colorbar Matte in Bare</a>(<em>Another favorite</em>), this does not have much pink undertone and is a natural nude in all sense. Fades evenly and does not leave and tint. I can detect some cocunut like smell, although very mild.

Formula is creamy and non drying and lasts me good 2-3 hours without meals.

**Bangalore Traffic is crazy these days, it took me 2 hours to reach home, which is just 3 Km from my house. The only 1-2 hours of my blogging pleasures is getting a set back.. need to find a solution soon for that. Till then please bear with me.
