I have been using soulflower soaps, for quite sometime now and have discovered some really good pieces and some ok ones. Mud A Lot named sound quite interesting and different and I had to pick this one up,

<strong>ABOUT MUD SOAP</strong>

</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine a pond of cool comforting wet mud in the peak of summer. Thai white mud offers cooling, healing &amp; protecting natural body &amp; face treatment. This mud, which effervesces in water is combined with cool vanilla to help draw out impurities, heals wounds &amp; clears rashes, which are so common in the summers. Rub the mud side of the soap &amp; keep on skin for a few seconds then wash off using the white side.</p>
<strong><em>Mud Soap is suitable for all skin types, specially for use in hot summer.</em></strong>

<strong>Ingredients: </strong>Vanilla absolute, crushed vanilla pods, white thai mud, Vitamin E, glycerin, aqua, saponified oils of olive, coconut, castor, palm &amp; palm kernel.

<strong>My experience:</strong> Nothing actually stood out when I used this particular soap. This is supposed to heal skin, and cool. I found it moisturizing though and did not have to rush to my moisturizer immediately. Very mild smell nothing noticeable.

<strong>What I liked:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Its moisturizing,</li>
	<li>Does not melt like crazy,</li>
	<li>Last me around 3 weeks,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Did not find anything healing or calming about it.</li>
</ol>
I found it an average soap, and was fun to try a new soap. Lathers well, is moisturising and lasts long. Maybe one needs to use for a very longtime, such effect do take time.
