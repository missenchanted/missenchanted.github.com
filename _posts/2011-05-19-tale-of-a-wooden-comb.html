Most of us are not aware of the fact that plastic combs are not good for hair health.Â  They are one of the major cause for
<ol>
	<li>Split ends,</li>
	<li>Root damage, that can lead to hair fall,</li>
	<li>Static charge that makes hair fizzy,</li>
	<li>Damage to hair cuticle.</li>
</ol>
Not only does wooden comb remove the above injuries to hair, but helps in
<ol>
	<li>Natural hair oil distribution on scalp,</li>
	<li>Essential/Aroma oils can be added to the comb, they leave behind a desired fragrance into the hair</li>
</ol>

Wooden comb need some care, they should never be used on wet hair as this may cause wood to absorb water and deform. But yeah it can be used on damp and toweled dried hair, thats no issue :D

Say no to PLASTIC :)
