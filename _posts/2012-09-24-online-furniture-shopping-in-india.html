<p style="text-align: justify;">When I shifted to my new place, I sold off all kind of furniture that I had.... why ???? .... because I had mostly collected ply furniture from Zuari and some from HomeTown. Right now everyone in my home is living on the floorÂ  :P and my hunt for my kinda furniture finished just yesterday. I managed to place the order for Bed with side tables and Sofa with center table. Now I just have to manage with floor for another 3 weeks till the order is custom built :P</p>
After getting a hang on buying your cosmetics and you grocery online, I just thought why not furniture. I found some quite interesting websites and some great designs online and yes some great deals too, but I gave all of them a pass, because what I found online was mostly Sheesham or Mango wood and I am looking for complete teak in my house. I love the feel of the wood in the house, it sort of gives a peaceful ambiance and also because I want to grow old with Teak n my dear hubby .. he he
