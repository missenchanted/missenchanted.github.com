<h4> Budget Makeup Kit under Rs. 1000</h4>
<blockquote>I got a lovely mail from Koyal, who was looking for some good makeup products for everyday use but on a tight budget....</blockquote>
Dear Koyal,

This post is specially for you, and I have kept my budget limit as Rs.1000. Lets check out what is in the kit,

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Under-1K.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8332" alt="Makeup kit under Rs. 1000" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Under-1K.jpg" width="900" height="697" /></a>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Maybelline Clearglow BB cream</strong>( ~ Rs. 187) - Its the perfect blend for oily to combination skin. Gives decent coverage and glow. I use this on a regular basis.</li>
	<li><a href="http://missenchanted.com/lakme-perfect-radiance-compact-02/" target="_blank"><strong>Lakme Perfect Radiance Compact</strong></a>( ~ Rs. 160) - This has to be the best compact in this price range. Finely milled and blends like dream.</li>
	<li><a href="http://missenchanted.com/biotique-bio-almond-overnight-therapy-lip-balm-review/" target="_blank"><strong>Bio Almond Overnight Therapy Lip Balm</strong></a>( ~ Rs.92) - Its really moisturizing and best for use under lip colors. You can even pick up <em><strong>Maybelline Lip Balms</strong></em> they are also worth every penny.</li>
	<li>When I was looking for budget Lip Colors, I had so many choices,
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://missenchanted.com/lakme-enrich-lipcolors-classics-352-cherry/" target="_blank"><strong>Lakme Enrich Lip Color</strong> </a>(~ Rs. 225) - You might go mad browsing through the shades... there are so many to choose from.</li>
	<li><a href="http://missenchanted.com/colorbar-matte-lipstick-in-bare/" target="_blank"><strong>Colorbar Velvet Matte Lipstick </strong></a>(~ Rs. 225) - My personal favorite is <em>Bare</em>, its the prefect nude shade.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://missenchanted.com/maybelline-colorsensational-lipstick-my-mahogany/" target="_blank">Maybelline Color Sensational Lipstick</a></strong>(~Rs. 299) - Amazing shade range again.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://missenchanted.com/maybelline-colossal-kajal/" target="_blank">Maybelline Colossal Kajal</a></strong>(~Rs. 145) - I don't need to praise this one, every college girl has one in her bag.</li>
	<li><strong>Maybelline HyperCurl Mascara Black</strong>(~Rs. 188) - Best mascara is this budget without any competition.</li>
</ol>
All the above prices are mostly taken from online shops and add to <em><strong>~ Rs. 997</strong></em>, so that leaves us with Rs.3 spare for <em>Cadbury ladoo (Kyun mann main laddoo futa).</em>

While compiling this list I was amazed that so many products from Maybelline made it to the kit, great quality for amazing price tag.
