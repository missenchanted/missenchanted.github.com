<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy pre Valentine day guys, I am sure your plans must be set and you must be waiting for the clock to click 00:00 :), I thought today would be the most appropriate day to review this Chocolate delicacy by Soulflower. I am on my second bar of the soap, and quite like it if bought on sale (greedy me :P)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2912.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2692" title="IMG_2912" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2912.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 200 for 150 gm(1 brick)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SoulFlower says:</strong>
<strong>WHAT IS 100% VEG ORGANIC SOAP?</strong>
Soulflower soap is made with vegetable oils of olive, rice bran, castor, coconut &amp; palm oil. During the natural saponification of these oils, soap is produced. Glycerin is a natural byproduct of our soap making &amp; has humectant properties, attracting moisture to your skin making it softer &amp; smoother, one of the reasons that our soaps are so  beautiful on the skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2913.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2693" title="IMG_2913" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2913.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>Ingrediants:</strong>
1.<strong>Real dark chocolate</strong> is made from raw cocoa, which has the maximum amount of antioxidants &amp; flavanols making it an excellent moisturizer that leaves your skin soft &amp; glowing.
2.<strong>Cocoa powder</strong> imparts a wonderful aroma &amp; is a powerful antioxidant which protects &amp; frees the skin from free radicals, that cause significant damage to skin layers.
3.<strong>Cocoa butter</strong> is obtained from the same bean as chocolate &amp; is made up of small particles that penetrate even the smallest of pores; giving it high moisturizing qualities that help protect &amp; soften skin. Imparts a rich &amp; creamy lather to the soap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contains :</strong> Real dark chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, Vitamin E, glycerin, milk, aquaolive, rice bran, coconut, castor &amp; palm oil.</p>

Our soap is 100% veg soap, made from natural herbs, essential oils &amp; vegetable oils. Glycerin, which is produced naturally during the soap making process moisturises the skin.These natural ingredients make our soap bubbly, creamy &amp; soft. Soulflower soap comes in large bar sizes; you should cut how much you need, and store the unused soap in a cool dry place. This way you can make your soap last for a long time. Keep the soap in a soap dish, so that water drains away &amp; the soap is dry when not in use. Does not contain artificial hardeners &amp; preservatives.  Store in a cool dry place for longer shelf life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how I store my soaps and use them one at a time...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2916.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2695" title="IMG_2916" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2916.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>My Take on the product:</strong> I quite like this soap, in fact very much mainly because of two reason, the strong choco smell and moisturising characteristics. Although It smells more like Hot chocolate, but its very short lived and is lost after few minutes of bath. Another great feature is that it does not melt like crazy, even if I leave it with some moisture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Smells good, not exactly choco heaven, but yeah definitely hot chocolate,</li>
	<li>Is definitely the most moisturising handmade soap used by me,</li>
	<li>Does not melt like a lot of other handmade soaps,</li>
	<li>Lathers nice and cleans well</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Smell is not long lasting,</li>
	<li>In Store only available at shoppers stop, you can easily get them online,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its a good soap for dry skin, lathers good and cleans well. Moisturises the skin well, but still you have to coat the skin with a moisturizer. This product is on my good list and will definitely buy this again.</p>
