<p style="text-align: justify;">After My LUSH Karma experience, I thought of moving on to a cheaper alternative and plus I love trying new products :), I lay my hands on Fabindia soaps. I picked up a bunch of them depending on my skin type. I have been facing a lot of dryness, which Lush Karma also could not resolve.My first try is the Fabindia Jasmine soap.</p>

<strong>What I like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Very cute looking, as white as snow,</li>
	<li>Very decently priced,</li>
	<li>Lasts long, one bar with regular use last me more than a month,</li>
	<li>Definitely Jasmine smell, only while using it :(</li>
	<li>Does not melt like other handmade soaps</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Felt nothing like calming and Rejuvenating, unlike other fragrance based products,</li>
	<li>Smell is lost as soon as you step out of the bath</li>
	<li>Had no solution for my dry skin, although it was not meant to moisturize,</li>
	<li>Jasmine smell can be overwhelming for sensitive nose</li>
</ol>

<strong>Have you tried any Fabindia soap ?</strong>
