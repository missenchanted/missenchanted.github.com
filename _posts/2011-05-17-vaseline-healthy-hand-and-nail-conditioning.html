<strong>Vaseline healthy hand and nail conditioning hand lotion with keratin and vitamin E</strong>

It was of those casual shopping when you go for grocery and come back with some extra products. I picked up this product because I found the pricing so much reasonable than mine Marks and Spencer's almond hand lotion(review later).

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.50 for 75 ml (Dirt cheap)

<strong>Product boasts of:</strong> Vaseline healthy hand and nail lotion is formulated just for your hands. Its conditioning moisturizer are fast absorbing and non greasy. It nourishes for softer skin,knuckles, smoother cuticle and stronger nails
<strong>Claims:</strong> In 2 weeks, nails are 10X stronger

Too long to read and too much chemical for hands

Some of the above products specially paraben are carcinogenic and plus this product contains alpha hydroxy acid(AHA), that may cause skin to become sensitive and susceptible to skin burns and tan, this brings an overhead to cover your hands in sun and apply sunscreen.

<strong>My experience:</strong> I am in a habit of moisturizing my hand every time I wash my hands and that must be 10 times a day. With a cream loaded and packed with so many chemicals, it was a nightmare. This cream is definitely non greasy takes 2-3 min to get absorbed into skin.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
1. Dirt cheap
2. Non greasy
3. Attractively packed
4. Nail is definitely stronger as claimed
5. Smoother cuticle

<strong>What I don't like:</strong>
1. It's like a chemical bomb
2. Paraben is an ingredient
3. Because of AHA I have to apply sunscreen, why would i do that
4. Not so pleasant smell

<strong>My Verdict:</strong> I am moving back to my Marks and Spencer's Almond hand cream, or might buy some Fabindia cream and give it a try.
