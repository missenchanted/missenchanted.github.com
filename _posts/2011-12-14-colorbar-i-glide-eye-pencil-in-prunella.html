I Glide is the most creamiest and smooth pencil I have tried ever and Prunella is <em>mera wala purple shade</em>. In my earlier attempts to buy a purple pencil for a regular use.. I was always like not this shade... <em>thoda aisa... thoda waisa wala shade</em>, now I can say <em>prunella mera wala shade</em> :D

<ol>
	<li>Love the color, it is casual enough for office and yet be purple,</li>
	<li>Very creamy and smooth, just glides,</li>
	<li>Great pigmentation, single swipe is enough to get that color,</li>
	<li>I like the matte looks it gives and remains smudge proof,</li>
	<li>I like that Colorbar has given a colored stripe at pencil end, its great to identify in a pencil stack</li>
</ol>
<strong>what I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I just cannot get a perfect tip, when I sharpen it. I always end up using them with brush once sharpened:(,</li>
	<li>Unlike other gel liners it does not show on my waterline :(</li>
</ol>
