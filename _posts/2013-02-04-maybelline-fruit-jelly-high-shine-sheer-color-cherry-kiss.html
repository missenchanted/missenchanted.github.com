<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 150 for 10ml

<strong>Maybelline Fruity Jelly Lip Gloss cherry kiss: </strong>A tasty new sensation in shine- It is non-sticky in nature and has unmatched glossy shine that lasts through the day. Start with the center of your lower lip and glide gently towards the outer edges. Follow the same technique for your upper lip.

<strong>My Experience with Maybelline Fruit Jelly in Cherry Kiss: </strong>Firstly, I hated the fragrance. Fragrance is like melons and is very suffocating. I personally did not like the taste as well- it is TOO sweet and even if one small particle of it goes into your mouth, you will feel like vomiting. Fragrance and taste linger on until and unless you decide to remove this from your lips. I loved the sturdy, tube packaging. It is very travel friendly. However, the price is slightly high, but the gloss is thick. I liked the texture of the gloss a lot. It is exactly like that of thick jelly. The Maybelline fruit jelly has a nozzle, which spreads the jelly unevenly on the lips, which I did not like. The coverage is sheer but this one has a very high shine that stays on for 2 hours without any meals in between. I liked the fact that the whole list of ingredients is mentioned on the pack. Lips may feel sticky if not used in proper quantity. To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this one!

	<li>Travel friendly</li>
	<li>A Thick Gloss, which most of us prefer</li>
	<li>Complete list of ingredients mentioned</li>
	<li>Moisturizing</li>
</ul>
<strong>CONS-</strong>
<ul>

	<li>Taste</li>
	<li>Sheer coverage</li>

<strong>Final Verdict:</strong> I will recommend it to you if you like such fragrances and taste to be added in your gloss. I personally HATED the fragrance. If you are going to buy it, please swatch it at the store and check the fragrance and taste. It is an Average Lip gloss and I will not buy it again!
