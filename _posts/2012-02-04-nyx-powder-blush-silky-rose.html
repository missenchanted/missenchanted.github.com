This is one of the jems I received from Anamika in her NYX giveaway, and is my first NYX blush. This is beautifully pigmented pink/mauve blush. NYX is quite easily available in India but at a higher price, when compared to many other foreign websites.

Packaging is cute, but misses a mirror and brush. It a very pigmented shade, first time it looked very loud on me, fair skinned people have to a bit careful with the quantity on the brush. Blends smoothly and gives a natural flush. This would be great shade for dusky beauties. Best part will have to be the lasting power for me it stays around 4 hours. Ah forgot to add this doesn'tÂ  have any shimmer particles.
