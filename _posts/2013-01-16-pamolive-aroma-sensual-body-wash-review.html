Pamolive aroma sensual body wash is a pretty looking bottle, which will definitely draw your attention. The color of the shower gel is very enticing and  more enticing are the claims made by the shower gel. I have earlier used the <a href="http://missenchanted.com/palmolive-thermal-spa-skin-renewal-crushed-coconut-and-jojoba-butter-extracts/" target="_blank">Palmolive Thermal Spa Skin Renewal Crushed Coconut and Jojoba Butter Extracts Shower cream</a> which is highly recommended, its really good for the price tag.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 125 for 250ml

If the Palmolive Thermal Spa reminded me of Pinacolada(<em>my favorite drink</em>), this one did remind me of wine.. although I have never come across such light color wine. The color of the shower gel and the claims on the packaging build up an expectation that the shower gel will be really aromatic and give that spa like experience. So let me add here that please do have any expectation of any sort. The fragrance in the bottle reminds me of cranberry juice, but in shower it turns a bit preserved rose like.

The foam and lather are no doubt quite aromatic. But the aroma does not transfer onto the skin, neither does it linger in the washroom for sometime which is quite disappointing. Does not dry out the skin, but Is still prefer a moisturizer after the shower.

Do I recommend this... hmmm let me see. If you are expecting an aromatic spa like experience then NO, but if you looking for a decent shower gel in budget which does not dry your skin then you can give this a try.
