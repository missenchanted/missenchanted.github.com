<strong>Proactive acne treatment kit</strong>

I never had acne as a teenager but after 6 months of coming to Bangalore(July 2006) I started having small appearances on my forehead. I did not pay much attention thinking it to be some kind of allergy. When these acne did not budge for a month I consulted a dermatologist in Manipal Hospital Bangalore. Doctor had so many things to say e.g. every alternate person coming to Bangalore gets on with skin issues, because air is moist and we don't sweat etc. I was quite impressed and religiously followed his medicines. My forehead was completely burnt by the end of third day, and when ever I tried applying any cream, I could feel that my skin has broken in so many places. It burnt like hell. I was back at hospital, doctor suggested I visit his clinic in J.P. Nagar, as he has some milder medicines. But the result of this Hospital episode was 3000 bucks shelled out and got a burnt forehead and cracks. It took some time to recover, I was only using lacto Calamine(Review Later) at that time. I stayed away from chemical products used home based creams, but no help. After researching on net I came to know there is something called Adult acne and took tips like using Baking soda, eggs whites, but nothing eventually worked for me.

Almost a year before I saw proactive ad on MTV @ midnight :D and ordered the kit . I could do anything to get my flawless skin back. It was a 3 step procedure with some magic blemish cream. I purchased bottles for 2995 for 60 days with 100% back guarantee.

I followed step by step, but still the acne kept on coming, I called up customer care that it's not working and i want to return the bottles. They told me to continue as clean up of my face would require some time. After a month, nope even this product did not work for me.

<strong>Price:</strong> 2995 for 2 months supply with free refining mask

<strong>What product boasts of:</strong> Proactiv is different because it is designed to fight existing pimples and control future breakouts before they even surface on your skin. Proactiv treats the whole face—and neck, chest, shoulders and back as needed—in a way that helps to prevent breakouts before they even get started. Also, it’s formulated with soothing botanical like allantoin, panthenol, aloe and chamomile that leave your skin feeling smooth, healthy and hydrated.

<strong>Product contains:</strong> benzoyl peroxide, botanicals like allantoin, panthenol, aloe and chamomile

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Toner was refreshing</li>
	<li>They returned my money back completely without any trouble.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like</strong>
<ol>
	<li>This product did not work for me.</li>
	<li>Refining mask had a strong offensive smell with mild irritation, and did not work as spot treatment.</li>
</ol>
<strong>My Verdict</strong>: People claim that proactive has helped them become acne free. So anyone with acne trouble can try this out as it comes with a 100% return guarantee. It did not work for me,

<strong>How I have become Acne free:</strong> It was my cousin who had recovered from acne recommended me Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%(Night cream) and Clin-3(Day cream) also known as Clinikoskin, This combination as helped me to regain back my flawless self. I Love my skin:). Taking it as a long journey I have found that I have an extremely sensitive skin, any product with oil breaks me up. I am very cautious of what product contain and what is not good for health.

Good Night!!!!
