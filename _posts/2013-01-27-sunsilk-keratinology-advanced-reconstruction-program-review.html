<h4>Sunsilk keratinology advanced reconstruction program review</h4>
Indian market got flooded last year with so many new launches, and many amazing products which made us all so happy. Gone are the days when I used to hear girls requesting their relatives for Dove or Tressme products from USA, UAE etc. Even our old friend Sunsilk too got a makeover last year and introduced Salon quality products with Sunsilk keratinology advanced reconstruction program range. I have been using them for the last 3 months now. I am so happy with them, that I got myself another batch.

This is my most favorite pick from the range, and its the best hair mask that I have ever tried. Gives you smooth, untangled and manageable hair in just 5 minutes. I use it like a conditioner twice a week. This has been an amazing find for me last year. My sister, who uses medicated shampoos and treatment has brittle and dry hair. This hair spa has come like a saviour for her.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Super moisturizing, works every for brittle and hay like hair,</li>
	<li>Does not way down the hair, so they are still bouncy and have some volume,</li>
	<li>Unlike many other hair mask, this one does not leave behind strong fragrance into the hair,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong> <em>Absolutely Nothing</em>

I already got the second tub for myself, yes its really good and worth every try. <em>Highly recommended.</em>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 200 for 200ml each

Sunsilk keratinology advanced reconstruction program shampoo and conditioner claim to remove impurities and residue, and repair damaged hair.

For me(<em>oily scalp &amp; dry hair</em>), its more of a balancing shampoo. This neither rips of conditioner from the hair, yet cleans throughly. Overall its a good shampoo with mild fragrance. The conditioner is also very moisturizing, and the duo works almost like magic for dry, damaged or salon treated hair. The conditioner is as good as the Hair Mask.

I am not sure if they have travel sized bottles, if not then should totally give it a thought. In short I highly recommend these 3 products, and if you want to pick up just one, then go for Hair spa mask and your would love it.
