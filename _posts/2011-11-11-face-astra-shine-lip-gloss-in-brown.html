I own a very small set of glosses, and most of them are nude or natural pink shades. But sometime back I picked up <strong>Faces Astra shine in brown</strong>. Its true to its name and does make my face shine... you will get to know that in few line :)

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_1316.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1425" title="IMG_1316" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_1316.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>

<strong>Price : </strong>Rs.239 for 4.5ml after the discount

I picked it up from <strong>Fashionandyou</strong>, but its very easily available on <strong>Urbantouch</strong> and <strong>cosmetix.in</strong>.

<strong>What I liked :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Its not at all sticky and the texture is lovely,</li>
	<li>Because of shine component it does make lips more fuller,</li>
	<li>Easily available brand in India</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>As I earlier quoted about FACE shine... The glitter in the gloss spreads on my face with time and makes me look like a kid form fashion dress competition. Face shines like anything, and I am left with no option but to wash my face.Siggghhhhh</li>
	<li>No Coverage as this color is very sheer,</li>
	<li>Absolutely non lasting maybe max 1 hour,</li>
</ol>

Its a lovely shade, but with almost no staying power and glitter fall out all on my face, I am not going to purchase this again.

<strong>Have you tried astra shine yet ?</strong>
