<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently made a Soulflower haul from FnU, and I love that so much that I ended up picking 2 more soaps from their <a href="http://www.soulflower.biz/" target="_blank"><strong>official website</strong></a>. You have to agree with me that the website is very creative and fun to navigate... right na? I have always liked Soulflower products, but could never gets my hands on the complete range. Its my personal experience that Shoppers stop totally lacks variety and any kind of guidance regarding Soulflower products. And thats where this website is a sign of relief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Untitled1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2988" title="Untitled1" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Untitled1.jpg" width="601" height="512" /></a><strong>About Soulflower:</strong> Choose from our handcrafted range of aromatic candles,hand moulded ceramics,artificial flowers &amp; natural handmade spa products.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Complete range <a href="http://www.soulflower.biz/t-about.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> It is very easy to navigate through the website, its very well planned and organised. Each product has detailed contents, and usage details. I really appreciate such detailed information. I easily picked up two soaps for myself. Ordered on 29th feb, got a confirmation call on 1st March. Ordered reached me on 3rd with a acknowledgement call. Soulflower tracked the order very closely and that was really thoughtful. Ok so here is what I ordered, they also included few bookmarks, a keychain and a voucher too :)</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Complete range of Soulflower products, which I totally love,</li>
	<li>Great customer service,</li>
	<li>Fun and frolic website,</li>
	<li>Oh yeah, they have a <em><strong>Make your own soap</strong></em><a href="http://www.soulflower.biz/c-8-make-your-own-soap.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>,</li>
	<li>Loved the cute key chain,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>You can get still better discounts on FnU, but FnU sale does not come often and takes 2-3 weeks for delivery</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time to show off my rest of the Soulflower collection,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2992.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2990" title="IMG_2992" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2992.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My FnU shopping haul</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Do let me know, if you want me to review any product first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>I totally liked my shopping experience with them and would highly recommend them to everyone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>*I used a voucher to make the 2 soap purchase, but that has not affected my review.</strong></em></p>
