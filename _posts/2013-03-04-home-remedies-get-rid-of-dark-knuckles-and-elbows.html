<strong>Suggested diet changes</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Sounds like a clich√© but drink as much water as possible. Hydrated skin is the most healthy skin,</li>
	<li>Take food rich in vitamin E such as nuts, almonds, groundnuts, dry fruits etc,</li>
</ol>
<strong>Suggested external treatments</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Scrub - Use home made sugar scrubs 2-3 times a week to clean the knuckles and elbows,</li>
	<li>Lemon juice - is a natural exfoliater. Mix it with a little sugar to use as scrub,</li>
	<li>Hydrate, moisturize and pamper your skin. Use creams generously over elbows and hands 2-3 times a day</li>
	<li>Hand creams - After washing hands use a hand cream to moisturize,</li>
	<li>If you wash cloths or touch detergents very often, prefer using gloves for such activities,</li>
</ol>
There is nothing in the above list which is exceptional from our daily activities... just a little lemon, a little scrub, lots of water and your love that's what your skin needs.
