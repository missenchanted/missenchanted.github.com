My mom always prepares cream out of natural bees wax and its just the prefect formulae for chapped lips and feet during harsh winters. But I always avoided that cream when stepping out of the house since it felt very heavy and greasy. Bees wax with oil is a perfect blend for all skin woes in winters. Tender care has been a cult favorite from Oriflame, and I have heard such great reviews about this product that I had to buy this. I picked it up for 50% off from March catalogue and just love it.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My experience:</strong> I just love the packaging, its cute, sleek and classy. This is one versatile product can be used for any skin probelm likes chapped and rough skin. I used it as a lip balm under my lip colors, and its felt very light and gets absorbed very fast. Best use for me has to be as cuticle cream, it softened them in a day and I just cant stop using.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Its a versatile product for all skin problems,</li>
	<li>Very cute and chick packaging,</li>
	<li>Very light texture and gets absorbed very easily,</li>
</ol>
Although its an all rounder but I feel the quantity is quite less, and as lip balm its average as I have met better lip balms. I would surely recommend this cream, its a must for the handbag for those cuticle and lips emergencies.
