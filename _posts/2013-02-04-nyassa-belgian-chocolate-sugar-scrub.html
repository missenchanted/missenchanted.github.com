By now everyone must have got their <em><a href="http://missenchanted.com/january-2013-vellvette-box/" target="_blank">January Vellvette box</a></em>, and pretty sure that everyone has got Nyassa Belgian Chocolate Sugar Scrub sample. And consider yourself lucky if you did not receive this in the box. This is a plain and simple sugar scrub, and even a kindergarten kid can prepare if not better but at least same scrub in few minutes.

<strong> Price:</strong> Rs. 950 for 200gm

<strong>Claim:</strong> Chocolate, especially Belgian chocolate is a great antioxidant. Belgian chocolate soap which as rich as the actual chocolate. It smells like chocolate! Full of Luscious Oils to pamper your skin! Belgian Chocolate has skin softening properties, probably as it contains cocoa butter.

<p style="text-align: left;">The 40gm sample last me only 2 washes. Although the granules are very large but not at all abrasive, I think that the only plus point of the product. Believe me it does not smell chocolate heaven. Its a simple mixture of solid sugar, oil and chocolate <del>fragrance</del></p>

Sugar &amp; Salt scrub are great way to exfoliate that dead and dry skin. They remove the old skin and moisturize the underlying skin. In my books these are a must and have to be followed like a ritual. Believe me once you get addicted you are just going to love your skin. You can customize you sugar and salt scrub depending upon your fragrance likes and needs, using essential oils.

<p style="text-align: left;">I personally do not invest in Sugar and salt body scrubs, as I find them to be means of splurging. Although its doesn't hurt to pamper yourself sometimes, but you can find millions of recipes on youtube and DIY blogs.</p>
