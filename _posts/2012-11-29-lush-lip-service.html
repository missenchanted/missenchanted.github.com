<p style="text-align: justify;">LUSH has named this lip balm most appropriately as LIP SERVICE. I quite like this all purpose balm, for me I almost ended up using it as Nail cuticle cream and it works wonders that way,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7453.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5101" title="IMG_7453" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7453.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 600</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LUSH says:Â </strong>Our original super-softener. We've been making Lip Service for almost a decade, and it is still hugely popular because it softens lips, heels, toes, cuticles and elbows. It has a magical mixture of effective oils and butters, plus tangerine oil to tone. For cracked, rough lips always pay Lip Service. Once you've sorted yourself out, you can move on to others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7384.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5103" title="IMG_7384" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7384.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This balm has a hard waxy texture, and impossible to swipe with fingers. You have to use your nails to scrape out, which some might find messy but its not that much. Its a great balm for chapped lips and distressed cuticles. One night wonder for dry lips and since its not glossy, its a perfect base for lip colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No doubt its quite pricey, when compared to many other balms in the market which come for less than half this price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7454.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5102" title="IMG_7454" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7454.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>Would suggest this balm only to girls, who are looking for something really effective this winter and something totally natural.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will pick this up again, as my cuticles tend to take a very bad shape, due to house work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today is a very special day to me, I will be completeing my <strong>five years</strong> of my stay with my Best friend cum Hubby. Some how number 5, makes an event more special to me... its like 5, 10 etc are some importatnt milestones. We have planned to spent the whole day together living some old memories :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Have you tried LUSH LIP Service yet ?</strong></p>
