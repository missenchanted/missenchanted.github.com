<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>"Spiced Vanilla"</strong></em> reminds me of those sleek, Smokey colored vanilla pods which I have been longing to see, but my luck has not been strong enough. This cute looking tin is a total loot, I grabbed it at 50% discount. I have tried almost all flavors from TBS Born Lippy lip balms, and this has been till now the best one I ever tried.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2946.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2859" title="IMG_2946" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2946.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 340 (For me Rs.170 :P)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TBS says:</strong> This non-sticky balm quickly hydrates lips. It is flavoured with vanilla and a hint of spice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2949.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2860" title="IMG_2949" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2949.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>My Experience:</strong> I am quite happy with this product. It excels in all the fields a lip balm should. It keeps my lips moisturized for 3-4 hours without reapplication, can you believe that. The only sole problem with this balm is the whitish cast on the lips, which takes 15-20 min to go. I wont consider this a drawback because I love the way it takes time to get absorbed by my lips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2950.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2861" title="IMG_2950" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2950.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The packaging is just adorable, it looks like a muffin :yummy:,</li>
	<li>Really effective, keeps my lips moisturized for 3-4 hours,</li>
	<li>I love the subtle vanilla-spice smell, nothing overpowering,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Since it has a white creamy texture, it takes 10-15 min to get absorbed. Therefore if you are in hurry you, should not use this under lip colors :(</li>
	<li>I am not sure, but either this is limited edition, or comes around during Christmas only.</li>
</ol>
I would totally recommend this to everyone, specially because you don't have to reapply balm every few minutes and did I tell you, how adorable the tin can is :P
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Which is your favorite your lip balm ?</strong></em></p>
