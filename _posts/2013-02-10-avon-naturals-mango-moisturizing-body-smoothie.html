<h4>Avon Naturals Mango Moisturizing Body Smoothie</h4>
Avon Naturals Mango Moisturizing Body Smoothie product is my first skin care product from Avon. Do not blame me if you find lot of Avon product review from me. I love Avon products off late. Some how attracted too much towards them.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.189 for 150 ml

<strong>My experience with Avon Naturals Mango Moisturising Body Smoothie:</strong>

Before I say anything about the product, I must say I live in a place where the water is hard. The bathing and washing products do not lather well if used in little quantity. And now note that Avon Naturals Mango Moisturising Body Smoothie is a bath product, both body wash and hair wash.

Avon Naturals Mango Moisturising Body Smoothie is a product that comes in a short stout plastic bottle which is in the color of a ripe mango. The flip cap is strong and sturdy making it a travel friendly bottle. It smells of mango essence, a little artificial flavor of mango. It is mild smelling and pleasant, not very bothering though.

It lathers in the right amount. I dilute it in some water before using as a body wash. The product on its own is very thick and comes out from the bottle in the form of a single thick drop. It is a good body wash which does not leave the skin dry after rinsing. But, I feel it takes more amount of water than usual for rinsing, since it leaves a soapy stickiness. This is where it takes more water to get washed. Else, this is a good product.

I do not like this product as a hair wash. Lot of product is needed to remove the oil completely from my hair. Instead I would prefer my usual shampoo.

So, overall Avon Naturals Mango Moisturising Body Smoothie is a good body wash product which leaves the skin smooth and clean without drying.
