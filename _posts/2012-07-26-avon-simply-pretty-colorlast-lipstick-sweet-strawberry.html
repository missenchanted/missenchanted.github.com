I had this lip color for so long, but it just got lost in the stash, how, when and why.... silly me. This is such an intense lipcolor like squashed strawberry, although it might look like more of mixed jam in the bullet... Ok now I am getting hungry..

<strong>Price:</strong> 299, but Avon comes up with really good offers,

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> Although its looks more of deep red, but its its more on the brighter side, and truly lives upto its name COLORLAST, It stayed for like 4-5 hours even after drinking and eating and @ Rs.229 thats a crazy loot. But on second thoughts It can be because of rich pigmentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only drawback is the plastic packaging, which makes it feel cheap, but at this price I ought not complain :P</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially it looks glossy but dries down to matte, gives complete coverage and does not dry the lips. With staying power of 4-5 hours I so wanna try out some more neutral shades. SURPRISINGLY I cannot locate in in the brochure... please help me out here.. is it discontinued ?</p>
