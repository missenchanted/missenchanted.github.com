I am a Kajal girl :P which means I don't step outside the house without that sharp line of kohl on my waterline. Ok now you will ask how about if there is no Kajal..... aha then I wont go out :P he he

I happen to pick up Avon extra lasting kajal &amp; smudger a month back when it was launched.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_2766.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2250" title="IMG_2766" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_2766.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.229 for 1.14g, but I got it for 159

<strong>Claims: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Improved formula with smoother texture for easier application,</li>
	<li>Soft creme formula that lines and defines without pulling and tugging,</li>
	<li>Special oil absorbing formula absorbs excess oil for longer wear,</li>
	<li>Use the smudger for easily smooth blend</li>
</ul>

<strong>My take:</strong> Its a beautiful pencil made of wood, which is not very smooth while sharpening and a lot of product gets wasted. Its not fully smudgeproof. The shade is not the darkest that I have ever used but I really like the smudger part its good quality and easily gives a smokey look.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Very decently priced and easily available through Avon consultants,</li>
	<li>Pencil and smudger in one , quite handy and with caps on each side its travel friendly,</li>
	<li>Lasts quite long on the lid without fading for like 5-6 hours,</li>
	<li>Good pigmentation though not the darkest</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Sharpening is not that smooth and some part of it gets wasted,</li>
	<li>Has a powdery texture instead of a creamy/waxy for a Kajal,</li>
</ol>
Its a great pencil for a quick smokey look, but as a kajal I don't prefer this as the texture is quite powdery, not very intense on waterline and for watery eyes it will smudge.  But for this price its a good looking pencil  for your pouch and comes in handy for a quick smokey look .

<strong>Do you like smokey looks ?</strong>
