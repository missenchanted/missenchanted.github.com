<h4>Book Review: Nicholas Spark - Dear John</h4>
I am not a die hard romantic when it comes to expressing love. But I have always loved stories and movies that touch special corner of your heart, and make you feel all that warmth and pain. I adore and love such stories to bits. Nicholas Spark in undoubtedly the most loved romantic author of our times, and I never miss out on his books. <em>Dear John </em>was with me for the last two weeks and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

Its a pure love story where emotions speak louder than <del>words</del> action. A long distance relationship and its survival against all odds, a relationship between father and son. It will remind you of your love life too, its that real and genuine. The characters are woven so beautiful you end up relating with them.

Next two pictures will give you a glimpse of what to expect from the novel...

Ok I do have a complain but not with the book but with the movie... they changed the climax of the movie. But I loved the end of the book more than the movie.

<em><strong>Can't stop sharing my favorite song from The Notebook again from Nicholas Spark... you need to hear this and you will fall in love with the lyrics... I swear..</strong></em>
