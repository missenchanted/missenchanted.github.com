Had a real hectic weekend, loads of shopping for an upcoming wedding. Got myself a beautiful Indian dress in purple, just can't wait to show it and exploring a lot of makeup options as of now.

This is my favorite conditioner ever, its just so yummy...... no I did not eat it ewww, but I was surely tempted many a times :)

<strong>My experience: </strong>I am in love with this conditioner, it smells and feels like banana puree. It gives my hair lots of volume and is not at all greasy. Perfect formula for greasy scalp and limp hair.

This is my third bottle in a row.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The fragrance definitely,</li>
	<li>It moisturizes and gives volume,</li>
	<li>Silicone, sulphate and paraben free</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The consistency is a bit dense, so its hard to get it when a little is remaining</li>
</ol>
Me and my sister just love this conditioner. Would totally recommend this if you are looking for volume, or if your conditioners leave you with limp hair.

<em><strong>Which is your favorite conditioner ?</strong></em>
