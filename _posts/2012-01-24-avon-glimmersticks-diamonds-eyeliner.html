<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently got hold of these pencils, and picked up <em><strong>Smokey Diamond</strong></em> and <em><strong>Black Ice </strong></em>and I am glad that I did. I went for more casual shades, so that I can use them for office too. Although it read <em><strong>Diamonds </strong></em>but its nothing shimmery for natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2852.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2536" title="IMG_2852" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2852.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="566" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.299 (I got its at 50% off)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My experience:</strong> These are retractable pencils, so the overhead of sharpening is gone(believe me for me that's the biggest issue). These are more of dried crayons, yet very smooth and just glide over the eyes the line, bit shimmery, but nothing much under natural light. Its definitely waterproof, and do not smudge at all, once dried(which takes around 1-2 minute). Has good staying power, it lasts me 8-9 hours before fading away a bit. I am currently in love with these and waiting for another offer to pick up the other colors too.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Retractable pencil,</li>
	<li>Totally smudge proof after 2-3 minutes of application,</li>
	<li>It feels like dry crayon, but smoothly glides over the eyes,</li>
	<li>Very decently priced, if picked during discounts,</li>
	<li>Glitter is very subtle under natural light,</li>
	<li>Good stay power,</li>
	<li>Can be used as eye shadows, if blended carefully just after application.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Careful, how much pencil you use, else it might break,</li>
	<li>Can get only through Avon representatives,</li>
</ol>

I really did not find anything wrong with these pencils, and is surely going to pick up the other colors from this range :)
