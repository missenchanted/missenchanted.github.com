Hi Girls, I know many of you have been waiting for the giveaway result, but thanks to all of you for such an overwhelming response that it took me ages to pick and winner and verify the entries.... The first pick for the winner had to be rejected, since she had left no links in rafflecopter for verification and that made me really sad, and I had to pick a new winner....
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>AND THE WINNER IS....</strong></em></p>
<a class="rafl" id="rc-efcf5e6" href="http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/efcf5e6/" rel="nofollow">a Rafflecopter giveaway</a>

<p style="text-align: center;">Dear <em>Racheal</em>, please confirm by sending us an email in next 48 hours, by sending us your shipping details.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sorry for the rest broken hearts, but seeing love for Etude... I am already trying to get few more Etude House goodies for the lovely girls out there...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have a great week ahead.</p>
