<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad time for wine</h4>
I bought the Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad time for wine owing to its lid and crease color. A single glance at the lid and crease colors made me want this quad so badly. The combination of 4 colors in the Maybelline Expert Wear Eyeshadow quad palette has been named as <em>Time For Wine</em>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5840" title="MAYBELLINE EXPERT WEAR EYESHADOW 70 Time For Wine 1" alt="Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad time for wine review &amp; swatches" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-1.jpg" width="900" height="676" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.240</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is nothing much to say about the packaging style of the product; 4 colors arranged in a pattern that together forms a square pallet. The pallet has a clear see through plastic lid that shuts with a click. Two sponge applicator brushes (one sided) are included.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5841" title="MAYBELLINE EXPERT WEAR EYESHADOW 70 Time For Wine 2" alt="Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad time for wine review &amp; swatches" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-2.jpg" width="900" height="676" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The texture of all the 4 colors included in this pallet is very good. No fallout of the colors has been observed while applying. They do not form a dusty clumped texture too. The finish of the eye shadow colors is smooth and easy to apply too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5842" title="MAYBELLINE EXPERT WEAR EYESHADOW 70 Time For Wine 3" alt="Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad time for wine review &amp; swatches" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-3.jpg" width="900" height="626" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am very impressed with the lid color. It forms an extremely good base color. The lid color is very close to my skin color and covers up my dark circle skin on my eye lid to a great extent. If you need a bright color pigment for the lid, then this is not the color for you. The lid color is my personal preference since it vanishes into my skin.  The lid color seems a little creamy with no shimmers. The crease color however disappointed me. I believe it is because of this color the quad has been named as <em>wine.</em> The crease color somehow enhances my dark circles; it makes me look darker around my eyes. So, I am not in a mood to use this any time. The wine crease color is satin textured with silver and mixed type of blended shimmers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5843" title="MAYBELLINE EXPERT WEAR EYESHADOW 70 Time For Wine 4" alt="Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad time for wine review &amp; swatches" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-4.jpg" width="900" height="676" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outer corner color has the base color similar to that of the crease color, more of dark wine with golden glitters. The glitters stand out. People who hate bling things will not like this shade, and so is my taste too. This shade too makes my under eye circles look very prominent. The brow bone is a milky pink with highlighting shimmers. This had not got my attention in the beginning. But, later on I use this highlighter shade a lot; a perfect one which brings glow and throws a good high lightened feel. However this is a little more powdery in texture.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5844" title="MAYBELLINE EXPERT WEAR EYESHADOW 70 Time For Wine 5" alt="Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad time for wine review &amp; swatches" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAYBELLINE-EXPERT-WEAR-EYESHADOW-70-Time-For-Wine-5.jpg" width="900" height="676" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, out of the 4, only 2 (lid and brow bone) have been put to use considering my taste and dark circles. Brow bone highlighting color stays as long as I wash it. And the lid color does not make any difference if it fades off since I use it to mattify my eye lid area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This pallet is a perfect selection for light skin tone people, and again only if no dark circle skin around the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I liked:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Easy handling eyeshadow case.</li>
	<li>Good base color and brow bone highlighting color (personal preference)</li>
	<li>Two average quality sponge eye shadow applicator.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The crease color and the outer corner colors will not help if you have dark eye circles.</li>
	<li>The lid of the eye shadow pallet is not made of sturdy plastic.</li>
</ol>
