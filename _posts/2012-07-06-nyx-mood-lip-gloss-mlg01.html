<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Only if there can be a product which changes with the mood of a gal, has to be the best invention by a human ever and boy's best friend ever.</em></strong></p>
When I received this, I was in a really good mood, because dear Ana sent me this in her International giveaway.. yohooo. NYX Mood lip gloss changes colors and works as a mild gloss and can be paired with any lipcolor, but this is certainly not on my list for future purchase.... reason I am just not in mood :P

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.440 in India, but in US its for 4$
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Claims:</strong> Magic lip gloss starts off clear then turns into the most  perfect shade of reddish pink on your lips.It’s a tube of heavenly shiny bliss and your lips couldn’t be any more natural and sexier</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> Its a clear gloss the minute its out of tube, then takes up a very mild pink color, which looks good on the lips. Packaging is very travel friendly, easy to squeeze out and apply. This is one shade, you don't have to think twice before buying, but dries up my lips. I have to use a lip balm underneath. Thats why I prefer to pick up tinted lip balm over this, but gals who don't have dry lips can surely give this a try.</p>

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Even when the gloss effect is gone, a beautiful stain is left behind on the lips</li>
	<li>Packaging</li>
	<li>Color is meant for all skin tones and color</li>
	<li>Very cheap, if picked up from US,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I wish it was moisturizing, I would have hoarded this for months to come</li>
</ol>
As a person with dry lips I am going to stay away, but you can surely give this shade a try once.
