Only if you want to return favors to your skin, its so necessary to remove every trace of makeup and dirt before going to sleep. Skin repairs itself the most at night and you better leave it free to breath and work its charm.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> This is the most light cleansing cream I have ever used. Being gifted with oily skin, I always opted for makeup removers and then just use a face wash. I was scared to use cleansing cream since they felt heavy and greasy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The texture of this cream is what makes it stand out from other. Just take a coin size dollop and massage all over the face, including eyes and lips. I prefer to use warm water and a soft muslin cloth to remove the cream. Muslin cloth gives a nice scrubbing action and warm water makes sure I remove the cream completely. Girls with dry skin can just use cotton and normal water as warm water might leave you with dry and stretchy feeling.</p>
This cream does its work and you can see how it worked, I tried glitter and sticky product on the hand and everything came out in two cotton swipes and 10 seconds of massage,
