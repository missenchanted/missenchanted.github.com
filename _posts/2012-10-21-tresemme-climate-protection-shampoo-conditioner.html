<h4>TRESemme' Climate Protection Shampoo &amp; conditioner</h4>
<span>I had come across <span>Tresemme</span> during my stay in South Korea. I even used some particular shampoo from them, which I don't remember now. I was really happy when I heard <span>Tresemme</span> was launching in India, and grabbed up the smallest portions possible to give them a test run.</span>

I have always experimented my hair with volumizing range from almost every brand, but I could not find anything volumizing from <span>Tresemme</span> India so I opted for climate protection. I am really impressed with the quality and pricing of the product. With one wash I could feel that my hair felt smoother and softer. I was't expecting any volume, since it is supposed to control frizz, but amazingly it did not make my hair limp.

I totally recommend this to gals with dry hair, or unmanageable locks. I am sure you will love it too.

<em><strong>I am eyeing their styling products now, Any Suggestions ?</strong></em>
