Sorry guys, had to stay away from the blogging world due to neck slip disk(Will do an article on ergonomics and home office soon) :(, Finally life is returning back on track in a very slow pace after a month's absence.

Finally starting from where I left off :)

Presence of minute shimmer particles make the removal so tough.

Will not purchase this again :( Although a beautiful shade but a headache to remove.
