<h4>Faces Mono Eyeshadow (International Range) – Review and Swatches</h4>
Hi Girls!

I am back this time with Faces cosmetics again. I have bought quite a few pieces from Faces cosmetics as I feel this brand is quite underrated. The exclusive outlets have a good range of brushes, make-up and skin care all of which are never properly displayed so customers never have an idea what lies within. I popped in a few days back and discovered that they had 50%  off on single eye shadows and long wear eye pencils. I usually don’t buy single eye shadows as I find palettes economical. Since I was anyway looking for a dark brown matte shadow (<em>I was going to buy Mac refill</em>), I swatted the Faces mono eyeshadows and was amazed at the quality.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs 549 for 2g. I got it for 50% off at Rs 274 each

I picked up matte <em>dark brown eye shadow</em>, <em>champagne lid/highlight</em> colour and a <em>coppery-plum</em> colour to make a ‘<em>neutral set</em>’

The Faces single eye shadows reviewed here are not the same as the faces ‘<em>Glam on</em>’ Single Eye shadows that retail at Rs 249 online and at Faces counters. I was confused myself so I checked out the Faces Cosmetics website and posted my question on their Facebook wall.  They confirmed that these eye shadows available at the Faces store are the international range which is imported by Faces India.

The Faces single eye shadows from international range are superb quality and much superior to the Faces Glam On range which is made in India. Both powder and cream eye shadows are available but I picked up only the powder shadows since cream shadows don’t work for me.

The eye shadows are available in a cute mono pod that is quite sleek and clicks firmly shut so no chance of opening, but can be a bit hard to open. The pod is magnetic – the pan comes out. Faces in India don’t sell the refills, so pods can be reused to store other pans that may fit.

This range of eye shadows doesn’t have names but only numbers. The Matte brown shade - FES00239 is the darkest brown shade. The champagne shade is numbered FES00127 and the coppery plum shade is FES00125. I found the rest of the shades here

Internationally, they are priced at $10 so at Rs 549 in India they work out to be quite reasonable.

The shadows have a finely milled texture and are highly pigmented. The dark shades have some fallout when applying. Just a little is needed of this dark brown shade in the crease or for a smudged eyeliner look. It blends easily however with primer the colours really pop and stays for at least 6 to 7 hours. But not all shades are great - I took nearly 1.5 hours of swatching and testing to decide on which three shades to get. Since I was planning get MAC Ricepaper/Embark/Espresso, I got these instead.

The Faces stores do not have testers for all eye shadows and some of the beautiful shades in the drawer are not displayed! I took a chance on #127 but it turned out to be a beautiful champagne shade which makes my lids look luminous.

<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Mac Dupes for the budget conscious</li>
	<li>Excellent value for money as they will last at least 2 years</li>
	<li>Highly pigmented and nice texture</li>
	<li>Pods can be reused for brow powder. MAC and Inglot pans should also fit.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Not all shades are great. Swatch before you buy! The neutrals are wonderful but some of the bright shades lack the punch.</li>
	<li>No refills available</li>
</ul>
I would honestly pay the full price for these and buy whether or not they are on discount. I would have gotten more shades except for the fact that I already have too many palettes and it would take me years and years to finish what I already have.
