With so many websites providing alluring discounts, I sometimes get confused from where to buy :) So I thought of making my first purchase from urbantouch.com. Placed my order on 27th and received it on 31st.... that was quick.

After reading Vaadi pack review on wiseshe, I bought it immediately along with my regular cream and compact. Both of them at lower prices as compared to what any store would ever give,

I just made it my Nail art box :)

Much better than many other websites do.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_2307.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636" title="IMG_2307" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_2307.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a> They added a few samples and a 10% off Lotus coupon.. but nothing much of use to me :(

<strong>What I like :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I totally liked their delivery, very safe, steady and not to forget the cute box... <strong>Thumbs up</strong></li>
	<li>I like the way things are categorized on website, it becomes easy to shop,</li>
	<li>The have free shipping without any minimum shopping amount,</li>
	<li>Cash on delivery,</li>
	<li>They sport brands like NYX, and OPI which are not that readily available in India</li>
</ol>
<strong>Suggestion:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>More variety in some brands like Aroma Magic, NYX</li>
	<li>I hope they keep some Nail art stuff..... my weakness</li>
</ol>
Have you shopped with UT yet?

They have a surprise gift for those who order above Rs. 500.. its a limited time offer.
