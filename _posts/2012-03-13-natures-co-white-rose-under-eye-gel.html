<p style="text-align: justify;">Phoenix City Mall, Bangalore is the new buzz in the town with so many international brands making it their hub. Nature's Co opened their first store here in the month of January, and I happened to pick up a couple of products. Its a nice little space on the ground floor with a small spa place. So here is one of the item I picked up,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2878.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3008" title="IMG_2878" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2878.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.345 for 20ml</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nature's Co says:</strong> Get Beautiful eyes in a blink. White rose extracts do a lot. They moisturize hydrate and stimulate blood circulation. Its anti-inflammatory properties, prevent puffy eyes, dark circles and help to reduce fine lines, while keeping new ones at bay. Apply at night before sleeping by tappng gently with your finger tips around the eve area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contains:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2882.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3009" title="IMG_2882" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2882.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>My experience:</strong> First about shopping, with first purchase you get a free membership card which entitles you a 12.5% discount for future purchase and a 25% discount on birthday. You also get a 10min foot spa card valid for 3 months, although I don't intend to use it. This is a cream which lives up to everything except dark circle and wrinkle improvement. Its a gel which gives cooling sensation, and removes puffiness. Moisturizes the skin well, but hardly does anything for Dark circles and wrinkles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before pros and cons, I would like to add that I have been using this religiously twice a day for last 2 months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2883.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3010" title="IMG_2883" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2883.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Cools the eye, will be great for summers,</li>
	<li>Removes puffiness and tired look,</li>
	<li>Since its a gel, gets absorbed easily and moisturizes well,</li>
	<li>Smells like rose water, which I find quite pleasant,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Does nothing for dark circles and wrinkles,</li>
	<li>Its quite liquid for a gel, gets wasted a lot, I have to be careful with the tube,</li>
	<li>Not that easily available, stores only in major cities and through official website,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I might not purchase this again, and move back to Aroma magic under eye gel. I had a better experience with AM. Only positive I would say is the calming rose smell and cooling effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Which is your favorite eye cream?</strong></em></p>
