<strong>TBS Shea shower cream review</strong>

Bought this product some time back. I wanted to try out a soap free cleanser for some time and inclusion of Shea butter was like cherry on the cake. I presumed that I wont need any moisturizer after the use.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.325 for 250ml (Got it for 295 SALE TIME :D)

<strong>Product boasts of:</strong> Shea butter from Ghana, is one of nature's great moisturizers. Ghanaian women have used it for centuries to protect their skin from the dry Saharan winds. So who better to buy ours from than the Tungteiya Shea Butter Association, Northern Ghana. An association of around 400 women from 10 villages, we ensure a fair price for their product. Since trading with The Body Shop the women have been able to dramatically change their lives with water pipes and wells saving hours of water collecting, better housing, medical care, food, and self esteem. Importantly, they are also able to give their children, particularly their daughters, the chance to go to school. Beeswax from the remote tropical forests of North West Zambia, where the extra income helps more than 3,000 beekeepers preserve their traditional way of life.

Dry skin will love our soap-free cleanser, packed with moisturising Community Trade Shea butter. You'll feel the softness.

	<li>TBS doesn't test on animals</li>
	<li>Lasts 2 to 2.5 months, that's good enough.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I don't love about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Not quite a fan of the product smell, it seems medicinal to me,</li>
	<li>It doesn't lather :( not sure how other soap free cleanser act,</li>
	<li>Loofah or sponge is a must,</li>
</ol>
