<h4>Bangalore World 10K</h4>
<h4>23rd May 2010,</h4>
Since last 2 years I was missing out on being a part of Bangalore World 10K. This year I made sure I was there..
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/clip_image002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036" title="Bangalore World 10K" alt="Bangalore World 10K" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/clip_image002.jpg" width="576" height="768" /></a></p>
I got up quite early and managed to reach stadium on time. The place was completely packed not an inch to spare. They started off with Elite women category and next to follow was the Bangalore World 10K.

I had never ran more than 4K in a stretch, was out of gym since one month, and thus I was full of apprehension if I can make it.

<!--more-->

<strong>4K</strong> was pretty good, saw Rahul Bose and Gul Panag on the way, Rahul about to finish the race.

<strong>5K -6K</strong> ran and walked.

<strong>9K</strong> completely walked,

Suddenly I met an old man on the way cheering the crowd and running bare feet, it filled me with enthusiasm and surprisingly I ran to the best of my ability and completed the <strong>10K</strong>.

<strong>Bangalore World 10K</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A word to all those reading, never miss out on the Bangalore World 10K, its a totally different experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For me it will be annual ritual,</p>
