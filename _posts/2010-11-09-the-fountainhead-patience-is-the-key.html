So you read it Patience is the key, but this key is useless, rusted and had no answer for me.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/the-fountainhead.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-76" title="the-fountainhead" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/the-fountainhead.jpg?w=183" alt="" width="183" height="300" /></a>Fountainhead had been mentioned in so many conversation since my school days, that I finally purchased the book with the hope of gaining some insight into the life of Howard and his obscure and not so easily understood visions.

Critics call it a Romantic drama with a philosophical angle. Thats some great comments to start a book with, but what I found reading churned my mind and eyes to such an extent that an adamant reader like me gave up on the last 100 pages, I was left with no motivation, or curiosity to finish the book.

I do not intend to bring anything wrong to the book, just that it was not with my cup of coffee.
