I had first bought this balm in South Korea, when Nuetrogena was not that widely available in India. I liked it so much and fortunately it became easily available to us :Angel:

<ol>
	<li>No doubt that its a great balm for dry and chapped lips, Its a one night wonder, an overnight application will give relief to major dry and chapped lips,</li>
	<li>Taste and odorless,</li>
	<li>I prefer tube packaging over tub packing any day,</li>
	<li>SPF 15 inclusion is a :Approve:</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Aminobenzoic_acid">PABA</a> free, so its good for sensitive skin.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Although its good for overnight application, but during day time it does not last long, I apply it every 2 hours during winters.</li>
</ol>
Its a simple lip balm and fulfills everything that it promises. If you look forward to color and fragrance, then its not for you :( else do give it a try.
