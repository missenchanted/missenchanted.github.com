Dove Elixir range has been recently launched and you can already see everyone is so excited to try out something new. The word elixir reminded me of the famous Kérastase - Elixir Ultime(<em>relatively quite expensive</em>) and Dove's attractive packaging with decent price tag compelled me to give Dove Elixir Dryness Care Lavender &amp; Olive Oil a try.

I have to applaud Dove for putting some thought into the design. Indian market lacks thoughtful design and I know most of you will agree to that.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 185

<!--more-->Its a heavy glass bottle with a pump dispenser. Encased are the beautiful flowers which give the packaging a feminine touch. The dispenser cap is though a bit flimsy and almost of no use. The idea of a cap for dispenser is a good one, which controls the amount of oil and also avoids any kind of spill.

Many would find the packaging bit heavy, I think Dove should come out with some travel size variations too.

The Oil smells like Dove shampoo and conditioner and not Lavender. It feels light and gets readily absorbed. I once left it overnight and once for an hour or so and the results were same. So the 30 minutes claim is all in all quite true.
Although I found it quite hard to remove it. My shampoo just did not lather(<em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/lush-jumping-juniper-solid-shampoo-bar/" target="_blank">LUSH jumping Juniper, which is known for its lather and effectiveness</a></span></em>). I usually swipe my shampoo bar once but with Dove elixir I have to swipe it like 15-20 times, which is way too much. So I am pretty sure mild shampoos just cant remove this oil.

Overall I would rate this as a good oil. It feels very light, gets readily absorbed and does live upto the 30 minutes claim. Only thing I did not like is that its a bit hard to remove.

I am still not sure, how effective this will be for frizzy and dry hair, but surely go ahead and give this a try. I am sure once you get this bottle, your first word would be "<em>Oh my precious bottle</em>"
