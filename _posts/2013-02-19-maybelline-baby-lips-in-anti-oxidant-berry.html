<strong>My Experience with Maybelline baby Lips in Anti Oxidant Berry</strong>

Well, I bought it solely for the packaging! I mean how anyone can skip such a gorgeous lip balm. I read the extravagant claims and I thought that it would be another one of those stupid lip balms, which would go into the trashcan. However, I was surprised that it works wonderfully and lives up to its claims.

It also has SPF 20 for sun protection. It actually is a fabulous product, which I am surely going to repurchase. Packaging is sturdy but the lip balm bullet is not so strong. It will break if you apply too much of pressure. Quantity provided is good and the product is worth every penny. Fragrance is tangy and delicious but sadly, this one is tasteless. The effect lingers on for long but the moisture only lasts for 2 hours max on my slightly dry lips. It has actually made my lips kissable. I love everything about this one. It does not have any color added to it, though. However, tinted versions of Baby lips are available in the market. However, one thing that disappointed me is that the 8-hour moisture claim is not true. Baby lips in anti oxidant berry is the Best lip balm, I have ever tried.
