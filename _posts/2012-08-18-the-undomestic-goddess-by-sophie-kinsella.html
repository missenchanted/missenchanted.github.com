I have been in Telecommunication Industry for over 6.5 years now and I quite enjoy my work. But I get these <em><strong>"I don't want to go to office"</strong></em>Â  moments so often. Anyways I heard about this book from the tweets of you all lovely gals and picked up immediately.

It took me 4 days to sweep the book,

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wont say I am impressed, neither was I disappointed. I will start with what I loved. This was my first book from Sophie Kinsella and she had a fresh way of writing, she made her characters so believable and lovable. I felt I was so attached to the female protagonist here. But the plot overall was quite ok. Its a good book to spend a weekend with a cup of coffee and cuddling in your couch and in the end you will feel the pride of finishing up a book soon (It happens with me, I feel so happy when I finish a book... sometimes it feels like an achievement)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you love chick flicks.. you are going to just love this book.</p>
