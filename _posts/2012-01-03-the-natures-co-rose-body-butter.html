<p style="text-align: justify;">Its the peak of winter season, I know its not that cold in Bangalore but its definitely very dry :( I have been using this body butter for over a month now and can say with guaranty that its one of the best body butters I have used .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_2734.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2275" title="IMG_2734" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_2734.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 1095 for 200ml</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rose body butter is from the <strong>Atmosphere range </strong>which is inspired by pure air that pays tribute to the soothing and calming feeling that comes from the purity found in the atmosphere. The oxygenating process of the products in this range makes your skin breathe, thereby leaving you feeling pure and almost floating on air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_2760.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2273" title="IMG_2760" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_2760.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My take on the product:</strong> I loved the packaging, its a cute and sturdy container but quite bulky to be carried around. It feels like a smooth but thick cream which gets absorbed quite easily and leaves a light rose fragrance. I have a very dry skin which spends around 10 hours in AC everyday but just one application in morning last me throughout the day and this is what amazed me the most :)</p>

<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li>I loved the cute yet sturdy packaging,</li>
	<li>Though the texture is thick and creamy but it melts into the skin very easily and leaves no greasiness,</li>

	<li>I love Rose fragrance, as you might be knowing so its a plus for me,</li>
	<li>All natural ingredients,</li>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;">I wish they come in smaller packs too, so that its easy to carry around,</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Availability is a big issue, but they have online shopping at </span><a style="font-size: 12px;" href="http://buyonline.thenaturesco.com/buyonline/">http://buyonline.thenaturesco.com/buyonline/</a></li>
	<li>I have never seen these products on discount, I wish we get occasional discounts,</li>
