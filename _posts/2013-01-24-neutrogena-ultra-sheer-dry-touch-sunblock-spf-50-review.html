<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50+ review</h4>
Hello beauties, What a bright sunny morning it is. This is my first review on Missenchanted and I am so so nervous….no, really I am. But at the same time excited too . Before I start reviewing any product I wanna start with a little introduction so that you can have a vague idea about the girl behind all this yap yap. I am Aayushi, a homemaker, married to a software engineer(that means I have to deal with my sautan all the time..yes you guessed it right…it’s my hubby’s laptop). I stay in Gurgaon and I love this city. So the product I am going to review today is Neutrogena Ultra sheer Dry Touch Sunblock SPF 50+
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Neutrogena-ultrasheer-dry-touch-sunblock-SPF-50+-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5812" title="Neutrogena ultrasheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50+ 1" alt="Neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50+ review" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Neutrogena-ultrasheer-dry-touch-sunblock-SPF-50+-1.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my personal opinion this is the best product from Neutrogena that I have ever tried. I am totally in love with this sunscreen. This has been my holy grail sunscreen for like 3 years now and I don’t think that I am ever going to change it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> 499/- Though it is available on almost all the online stores between 450-499/-</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Neutrogena-ultrasheer-dry-touch-sunblock-SPF-50+-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5813" title="Neutrogena ultrasheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50+ 2" alt="Neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50+ review" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Neutrogena-ultrasheer-dry-touch-sunblock-SPF-50+-2.jpg" width="483" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has a cream like texture which is more like whipped cream. Its the lightest sunscreen I have ever used. Very little amount is required for single application. As for the waterproof claim I really don’t know how true is that. Frankly, because I have never tested it under water.  It is sweat proof, a few drops of sweat here and there is not gonna make you reapply it again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has a very mild smell, which you might not even notice and it fades away quickly. Personally I like my creams to be fragrance free. I leave this job to the perfumes. I have very oily skin in summers and turns extremely dry in winters, so this sunscreen works in both the conditions. Though in winters I do apply a moisturizer under it but in summers it works perfectly fine as a moisturizer too. One tube lasts me 2-3 months very easily when I apply it on my hands too.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And one thing which I liked most about it is that it is “<em>PABA free</em>”. For those who don’t know PABA. It stands for Para-Amino Benzoic Acid. It is commonly used as a sun blocking agent and though it is completely safe, sensitive beauties may still have problem with it.  Presence of PABA sometimes even increase the chances of sunburn in some people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PROS-</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Light weight, doesn’t feel heavy at all.</li>
	<li>Very little amount is required so a little goes a long way.</li>
	<li>Gives you a nice matte finish which doesn’t look ghostly but is healthy instead.</li>
	<li>Packaging is travel friendly.(they have a smaller version of this too)</li>
	<li>Does not break out.</li>
	<li>Easily available.</li>
	<li>PABA free, those sensitive skin darlings out there…this one is for you</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONS-</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>May seem costly to some.</li>
	<li>Very light fragrance. ( this can be a con to those who like their creams to be nice and strong smelling).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would strongly recommend each and everyone on this planet to go grab it. Come on ladies..go invest 500 bucks and it’s my promise that you are not going to regret it.</p>
