<h4>Biotique Bio Berberry Refreshing Cleansing Lotion</h4>
<blockquote>This refreshing, non-foaming lotion is blended with berberry, red sandalwood, fenugreek, lodhra bark and almond oil to dissolve makeup and grime. Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</blockquote>
Biotique Bio Berberry Refreshing Cleansing Lotion is something that I picked up on a random note, for I was looking for a cream cleanser. You can check my mini haul from<em><strong> <a href="http://missenchanted.com/upcoming-biotique-reviews/" target="_blank">Biotique here</a></strong></em>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 149 for 120ml

<strong>How to use:</strong> Lightly apply onto face and neck with finger tips. Remove with damp cotton pads. Use skin freshener to remove last traces of dirt and makeup. Follow with freshener and then moisturizer.

Since I have oily skin, I prefer using a muslin cloth soaked in <del>hot</del> warm water to remove every trace of the cream.

The Cream is a slightly runny solution, which smells mildly fruity. Its easy to massage onto the face and removal also is not much of a problem. I like the fact that I can use this on my eyes and face at the same time.

Easily removes all kind of dirt and makeup, even Mascara. Leave the skin feeling clean and soft.

With everyday use 120ml of bottle easily last me one month or slight more, which is really economical. Biotique has made a slight change in the packaging, the mouth of the bottle which is better than the previous one.

<ol>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 13px;">Its safe and herbal, since it comes from the house of Biotique,</span></li>
	<li>Cream consistency helps in easy massage and makeup removal,</li>
	<li>Does not leave behind greasy feel after the use,</li>
	<li>Easily removes all kind of makeup,</li>
</ol>
There is nothing about this cleanser that I did not like. Its a plain and decent Cleansing lotion which works on all kind of makeup and leaves behind cleaner and soft skin.

If you are planning to pick up a Cleansing lotion then do give this a try.
