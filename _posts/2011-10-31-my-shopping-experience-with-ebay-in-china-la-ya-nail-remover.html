It may sound strange that I am an addictive online shopper but made my first ebay purchase recently. I was never able to find good deals on ebay :(, but after reading about the nail remover pads from Zara and Anamika, I just knew I had to buy them as soon as possible.

Ordered on Oct 27 and received it within 3 days,

Rs. 199 for all 6 tubs :)

Unlike dabbing cotton every minutes into a regular acetone bottle, the pad doesn't dry for a long time :D

I bought them from <a href="http://www.ebay.in/itm/330632062163?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649#ht_3316wt_802">here</a>
