</a>Kareena and her size zero figure was much talk of the town, more than the stock market's Bulls and bears. Although "Tashan" also managed a great size zero revenue but Boys were bowled out by the perfect Ms. Kapoor, and every girl had a new year resolution and the rest is history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since then every every Indian women is aware of Rujuta Diwekar and hers books. According to me its a must read for every human :) yup boys are counted in too :D. It busts all myths and supports facts to attain that perfect health and looks balance. This book never recommends dieting but surely recommends moderation :), slowly and gradually you feel healthy and sooner you look healthy. So no more calorie counting, giving up on those yummy paranthas and butter :P.Best part of the book is the way this book is compiled, with occasional insights into her own life and funny incidents with her clients keep you hooked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rujuta's word, never say your stomach is upsets, its just that you are trying to kill it :)</p>
