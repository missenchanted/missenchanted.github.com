In the year 1960 Harper lee, penned down the American society but with the eyes of a 10 year old(A incident she had seen around her in 1939). Although this book revolves around racial inequality, but still you feel the humor and warmth of the writer as the two kids mentioned in the story pour innocence with action of theirs. It reminded me of my young years with my brother, the ghost stories from neighbours, the drama amongst the friends. Indeed this book has touched my heart, and has a special place in my collection.

Author's father is the main hero of the story, who despite being white stands for the rights of black, honesty and humanity. It is one of the best read I ever had.
