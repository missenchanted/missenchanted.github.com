<strong>Fragrance and texture:</strong> It has a mild fragrance, which is not like that of the Pears soap. Fragrance does not linger on for more than 10 minutes. It has a runny texture and the shower gel has a sunset type color added to it.

<strong>Packaging:</strong> It has a convenient packaging (upside down) but squeezing the bottle is a bit tough. I wish the packaging was better.

<strong>My Take on Pears Pure and Gentle Shower Gel-</strong>

I liked this product but did not love it. It has a mild fragrance, which is soothing, and I would be happy if it lingered on for a long time on my skin. That is not the case. The fragrance fades in just 10 minutes. So what is the use of a nice smelling shower gel if the fragrance does not linger on? In addition, it moisturizes the skin nicely and removes dirt but then it is so difficult to remove this product! It leaves a slippery feel behind which I totally hate. However, I have to agree to the fact that it is super gentle to the skin and is perfect and safe for kids too!

Sadly, this product contains SLS (but every other product contains SLS). The product does not lather much (it contains SLS then also it does not lather properly! How is that possible?). Well, it is just an average shower gel and nothing great!
