I had picked up this mascara because it served both my requirements. Its waterproof and it not dramatic. This is my regular use mascara and being a corporate person I wanted something that defines my lashes but doesn't shout out loud.

Product says:

• Zero-clump mascara creates stunning length with clean definition
• Patented shaped-to-the-lash brush
• Ophthalmologist-tested, contact lens safe
• Waterproof, also available in Washable

How to use : Sweep brush upwards from root to tip to separate individual lashes and to achieve definition and length. Do not let dry between coats. Removes easily with soap and water or Expert Eyes® Moisturizing Eye Makeup Remover.

What I love about the product:
<ol>
	<li>Definitely no lump on brush and no lumps on lashes :)</li>
	<li>Available in two shades, but I always prefer black</li>
	<li>Nice packaging and easily available</li>
	<li>Clearly defines the eye lashes</li>
	<li>Not dramatically lengthening</li>
</ol>
What I don't like:
<ol>
	<li>Needs 2-3 swipes to get the correct look,</li>
	<li>No volume, no extra length (For this I use Maybelline Colossal Volum’ Express Waterproof Mascara)</li>
	<li>There is no packaging on the tube, so can never make out if a part of it has been used :( Terrible</li>
</ol>

Eye makeup is something where I like experimenting :)

Have you tried Maybelline mascara yet ?
