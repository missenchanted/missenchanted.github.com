<h4>Nivea Pure Effect Total Face Cleanup Wash</h4>
Nivea Pure Effect Total Face Cleanup Wash has to be the perfect receipt for a lazy girl's skin care routine and thats what made me pick this up on my last visit to Health and Glow. This product claims to be a multitasker wash, scrub, pack, oil remover and spot remover.

The concept of a product which is a 5-in-1 product was first introduced to us by Garnier, if you remember the Priyanka Chopra Ad.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs 199 for 150 ml and Rs 99 for 50ml

Comes in a plastic tube with a flip cap, which according to me is not that travel friendly. The first thing I noticed about the product is the fragrance, it smells like rose water. I love the subtle rose water smell. The texture is very clayish and creamy with very mild scrub particles.

I have been using this for almost 3 weeks now, almost every alternate day. I use it like a face wash cum scrub, just mix it with a little water. Leave it for 5 minutes and then wash away with luke warm water. Since the texture is clay like, it gets dried within one minutes but its not stretchy like clay.

It won't be that effective in removing makeup, so first remove makeup and then use this.

Overall its a decent budget pick. Cleans and scrub effectively and also controls oil to an extent(not the best though). But as a scrub, I did not like it very much. Also other claims such as spot reduction, I did not notice anything exceptional like spot reduction.

I would <em>recommend this only if you are looking for a 5 minutes solution</em> for your daily skin needs, as a scrub and face wash is good. But if you are expecting an effective scrub or any kind of skin lightening or spot reduction then give this a miss.
