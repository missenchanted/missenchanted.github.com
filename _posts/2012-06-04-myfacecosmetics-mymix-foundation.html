<p style="text-align: justify;">Its kind of tricky to get that perfect shade and finish in foundation. As a novice I always wished to get that natural flawless look, without any whitish cast, dry and cakey patches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This foundation is with me since last two months, but I never got a chance to try it out, since its a darker shade. <del>Luckily</del> Unluckily my regular 10K practices under the sun left me tanned, and this shade looked so much natural then. I am really happy and would love to introduce this,</p>

<strong>Price:</strong> £15.99 for 25ml

<strong>About:</strong>

For medium skin that tends to have medium to deep olive tones. MEDIUM 03 creates a rich, "caramel-y" glow. It camouflages any uneven skin tones and delivers that just-back-from-holiday glow.

If your skin tone is like Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba or Eva Longoria, choose MEDIUM 03.
<ul>
	<li>mymix foundations for MEDIUM skin celebrate the golden, honey tones while colour-correcting to masque any signs of sallowness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>lightweight texture leaves skin feeling like you have nothing on…but looking flawless.</li>
</ul>

<strong>My experience:</strong> What I liked the most about it is the long lasting dewing look it gives. The formula is very light and very easy to blend. I use my fingers which are just enough for that uniform coverage. This foundation gives a medium coverage and does not hide certain problem areas. Gives a dewy finish which lasts me 4-5 hours (I have oily skin).

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The dewy finish, thats definitely a plus for me,</li>
	<li>Very light texture,</li>
	<li>Very easy to blend, no brush required for that uniform coverage,</li>
	<li>Lasting power is good,</li>
	<li>Lots of shades to choose from,</li>
	<li>Does not settle into fine lines, neither looks cakey and fake,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I prefer a pump packaging, for foundations. More control on the amount that way,</li>
	<li>Available only online :(</li>
</ol>
This is a perfect everyday foundation with medium coverage, will totally recommend to those looking for natural and dewy finish. For complete coverage use of concealer and powder is a must.
