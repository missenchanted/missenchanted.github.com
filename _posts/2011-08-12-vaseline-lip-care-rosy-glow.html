Happy Friday :)

Have been using <a href="http://missenchanted.com/eva-lush-lips-nourishing-lip-balm-strawberry-bite/" target="_blank">Eva tinted balm</a> and BodyShop born lippy watermelon lip balm for sometime. My major lip issues are
<ol>
	<li>Quick dryness, even after balm application except when I use H2O gloss</li>
	<li>My lip biting habit, just don't realize sometimes when I do it :(</li>
</ol>
Buy I am really taken back by this product, its just for Rs. 60 but meets ALL my needs. Yippey I have found a balm for a long long time :-)

<strong>Product claims and contains :</strong>

<strong>What I like about the product:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Great shade :), I don't use any lip color or gloss these days to office, just the balm,</li>
	<li>Its leaves my lips feeling minty, and the feel lasts for quite sometime maybe an hour</li>
	<li>If you don't eat or drink, lasts almost 1- 1.5 hours,</li>
	<li>Leaves soft, supple and texture improved lips :)</li>
	<li>I like the packaging its hygienic and handy,</li>
	<li>So economical</li>
	<li>With Eva i faced the issue of color settling down in the fine lines of the lips, but this doesn't</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>When I use the tube, too much product comes out often :(</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_1314.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1284" title="IMG_1314" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_1314.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a>

Rest I did not find any issue with this. This is going to be in my bag for a long time.

Will advice this to everyone, except if you don't like minty feel, or tinted balm is a strict no no. <strong>But seeing the price it once a try once ?</strong>
