<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fabindia bitter orange facial spray</strong></p>
Bought this product 2 weeks back and have been using it since then. I use facial mist quite often, mine earlier mist was from H2O(Will review later). I am quite happy with this product very fresh, very orangy and soothing fragrance.

<strong>Product contains:</strong> Purified water, Polysorbate 20, Glycerine, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Bitter orange essential oil
All above products are safe to use and have no side effects(source Wikipedia).

<strong>My experience:</strong> Its small and cute bottle is so handy that I can even carry it in a clutch. My main usage is after Gym, when I feel tired and need some cooling effect to my face. I don't carry my cosmetic pouch to Gym, it's just lot many splashes of water on face and eyes, and a gentle spray of this product. It instantly cools down my face and love the smell it's so real orangy :). Best in times of street shopping, just take it out of your bag, spray and you ready to go.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
1. Fab India is against animal testing
2. Smells real orange and not like any chemical
3. Cute and small bottle easy to carry even to parties in a clutch
4. Cools and rejuvenate instantly
5. Decent pricing
6. I have a highly sensitive skin, spray does no harm to it.

<strong>What I didn't like:</strong>
Till now nothing as such :D

<strong>My Verdict:</strong> My H2O Mist days are over and its Fab India now. I liked this product a lot, infact planning to buy some more Fabindia stuff (Will update soon).
