<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a working Saturday, the bharat bandh played such a spoil sport and I am left with just a single day to tick off so many things on the list. I am a very slow player, anything I have to buy for the house... the decision takes weeks.. sometimes even months, I just don't want to pick up anything wrong. Thank God its not the same with other shopping, anything cute or exciting I just pick it up.. so was this cream...</p>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 169 for 50 ml. (<em>Got it for Rs.135 in current month offer</em>)

<strong>Claims:</strong> Ideal for when you’re on the move, an effective hand cream with moisturising, conditioning Glycerin and softening, protecting Sweet Almond Oil. Compact and easy to take with you, absorbs quickly and gives lasting hydration.
<p style="text-align: justify;">I always prefer two sets of hand creams in my vanity. A lighter variation for the day, since I work on a keyboard for 9-10 hours and greasy feel on the hands is seriously ewww, and a heavier variation for the night. So this is certainly my day hand cream and I am totally liking it. It gets readily abosorbed, and hand feel soft without any greasiness. Very mild fragrance, which does not bother me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its a good product, but not great. Would recommend this only if you don't have dry hands and you don't mind applying cream every 3-4 hours. Dry hands just give this a miss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Do you also carry two creams for your hand ?</strong></em></p>
