<h4>Oriflame Giordani Gold Body Cream Review</h4>
I have a good news, its FRIDAY!!!, this would be my first complete free weekend after 1.5 months. Seriously I have so many plans.. I have to go decor shopping, make some good use of ongoing sales, arrange house, watch TV etc etc. Coming to the product under spotlight today is the Oriflame Giordani Gold Body Cream. I have using this cream for the last 2-3 months and quite happy with it, so thought of sharing this today.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Oriflame-Giordani-Gold-Body-Cream-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5849" title="Oriflame Giordani Gold Body Cream 1" alt="Oriflame Giordani Gold Body Cream Review" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Oriflame-Giordani-Gold-Body-Cream-1.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.449 for 250 ml

The packaging is tub and bulky(<em>which I usually don't prefer</em>), but I like this one. A semi translucent jar with a golden lid does make the packaging look good. The cream consistency is light and the texture is smooth. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin and the fragrance is just awesome.

Fragrance is on fruity notes. Anyone who does not like fruity smell, will not like this cream. Fragrance has to be the highlight of this cream, and I keep it as my night moisturizer. It calms and does make me feel relaxed.

Best part is that the fragrance lingers on the skin for good 2-3 hours.

Its not a a heavy dose body cream, and you(Normal skin) might have to apply every 5-6 hours. I once used it as hand cream, but left me with sweaty palms, so its strictly not meant as hand cream. This cream can be used both for winters and summer.

This is my night time cream and I love it. Would recommend only to those, who love a dose of fragrance while sleeping, to relieve the stress and enjoy a good night sleep.
