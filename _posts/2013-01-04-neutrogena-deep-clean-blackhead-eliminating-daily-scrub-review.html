<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometime you just bump into good stuff for free. I got a 20gm sample of Neutrogena deep clean blackhead eliminating daily scrub sometime back with Femina, else I might have never tried out the scrub as I was quite happy with my LUSH cleansers. But this scrub turned out to be a such a great catch that I am already on my fourth tube.

<!--more--><strong>Claim:</strong> Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub doesn’t just fight blackheads, it helps eliminate them for clearer, smoother skin. This gentle scrub immediately works two ways to not only clear out the blackheads you have now, but also to help prevent new ones from forming.  First, you will feel it tingles as its maximum strength acne medicine, Salicylic Acid, penetrates deep to eliminate blackheads by removing stubborn dirt and oil trapped inside pores.  Then, you’ll feel its gentle, skin-soothing micro beads ex-foliate without over drying to help stop blackheads before they start.</p>
I do not have black/white head problem, but being any oily skin, I am always on a lookout for mild face scrubs that can clean pores without ripping off moisture from my skin.

Gone are the days when I used Apricot and walnut scrubs for my face and that too just once a week, although I still use them but only for my body now.It keeps me oil free for hours.. touch wood.</p>
Would recommend this to all skin types, since it can be used daily, removes dirt and makeup without drying out the skin. It a great budget buy and shall always be there in my bag.
