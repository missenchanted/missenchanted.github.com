<h4>Lotus whiteglow skin whitening and brightening gel crème</h4>
I love Beyonce and Malaika Arora Khan for their sexy tanned body. But i just can't take tan on me, may be because it doesn't look good on me. It doesn't  compliment my skin tone. And the product i am reviewing today is a purchase of the time when i wanted to get rid of my terrible tan. Its Lotus whiteglow skin whitening and brightening gel crème. I liked the concept of a gel crème, which meant that it won’t be too heavy for summer use.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Lotus-whiteglow-skin-whitening-and-brightening-gel-crème-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6373" title="Lotus whiteglow skin whitening and brightening gel crème 2" alt="Lotus whiteglow skin whitening and brightening gel crème" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Lotus-whiteglow-skin-whitening-and-brightening-gel-crème-2.jpg" width="900" height="780" /></a></p>
<strong>Price:</strong> Rs 295/- for 60 gm.

It comes in a beautiful glass tub with a shiny silver screw cap on it. The jar is quite heavy and definitely not travel friendly, but good to grace your dressing table.

And about the gel part, yes it is somewhat a mixture of a gel and a cream. It is a nice moisturizer for summers. It doesn't make my combination skin oily and doesn't cast a ghastly white layer on my face (that happens with Neutrogena fine fairness cream).

It has a very nice fragrance, which I can say is quite citrusy and fresh. The smell lingers on for about a few minutes and then fades away.

About the whitening claim, well yes it does whiten you, but I won’t  say  within seven days. I used this cream for around a month and my skin tone was back to normal.

Happy me. What more could I ask for. So even though I was in desperation to go back to my normal skin tone, I liked the way how slowly and effectively this cream worked. It may sound a bit illogical but I am quite relieved when such creams don’t show miraculous overnight effect, it kinda gives me a feeling that it is not that harmful for your skin. I discontinued using it after a month, because I think that one shouldn't use whitening cream for long. And I read it somewhere that it’s not good for your skin in the long run. Maybe because of some the chemical that they use.

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Lotus-whiteglow-skin-whitening-and-brightening-gel-crème-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6376" title="Lotus whiteglow skin whitening and brightening gel crème 5" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Lotus-whiteglow-skin-whitening-and-brightening-gel-crème-5.jpg" width="900" height="652" /></a> It didn’t brighten me and I was not even expecting. <em>Brightness is something that comes from within, a good diet, lots of fluid and your skin will surely brighten up.</em>

<strong> Pros:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A nice light moisturizer for summer.</li>
	<li>Has SPF25 PA+++</li>
	<li>Does what it claim, but at its own pace.</li>
	<li>A tub can last for 2-3 month.</li>
	<li>Affordable.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The risky glass tub.</li>
</ul>
As summer is drawing near, I am sure you all must be looking for a nice moisturizer.

<em><strong>Which one is your favorite moisturizer ?</strong></em>
