Crackle Nail paints were such a craze when they were launched, but I never picked up any since I always found them overpriced and was waiting for some angel to get me the Miss Claire Crackle Nail Paint from Mumbai.. and my BFF got me this amazing formulae when she visited me... and I am totally flaunting it these days.

<strong>Rs.</strong> Rs.150 (Approximately.. not sure about exact price though)

Picked up from Beauty Center, Mumbai

Used <em>MUA Nail Varnish in Bright Coral</em> as the base..

You need to keep your base coat ready.. either dried or non dried, it does not matter much.  Apply a  coat of Marie Claire Crackle nail paint and let the paint crack. Initially you will find a whitish crack effect on your nail, but it slowly turns silver after few minutes.

Comes in 10 different shades, these are some great budget picks, and would recommend every one to pick up at least one and flaunt those cracked nails of yours(<em>Not literally</em>)

Its really cold and chilling in Lucknow... but an amazing Ladies Sangeet today.. hoping to do a LOTD, I better click come good pictures :P

Have a great weekend :)
