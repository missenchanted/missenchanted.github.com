<h4>Ponds flawless white deep whitening facial foam</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey all, I am back with another review. This time its Ponds flawless white deep whitening facial foam. This is one of my favorite face wash. I have my early childhood memories of Ponds with that white ponds cold cream, that small dibbi. My mom used it and I loved the smell…then when I grew up as a teenager I used ponds body lotion which was very much affordable at that time. By the time I was in college, ponds had totally revamped itself. The market was flooded with age miracle range and flawless white range. I loved the way they came up with such a wide variety of products.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ponds-flawless-white-deep-whitening-facial-foam-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6065" title="Pond's flawless white deep whitening facial foam 1" alt="Ponds flawless white deep whitening facial foam" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ponds-flawless-white-deep-whitening-facial-foam-1.jpg" width="1200" height="1600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This face wash has the fanciest packaging among the ponds products. It is a shiny white sleek tube with a similar shining pink screw cap on it. I saw it first at my aunt's place...I told her that I liked the packaging very much and she lovingly gave it to me :D Lucky me!!! Since then I am hooked on. Though I keep buying new face washes all the time but it always stays there on my bath rack. And I keep using it on and off.</p>
<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 175/-

As you can see, the packaging is very sturdy. Now coming to the texture, it is white cream like in color with very fine pink granules in it….mind it, very fine granules. It has a pleasant smell which is not very strong and not bothering at all. Now here’s the best thing about this face wash. You require half a pea size to wash your face. Yes, that’s it. I know you won’t believe me but this single tube lasts me around 6 months. So my paisa is more than vasool.

I am not done yet….another best thing, it does its job very well. That means it cleans very well. It gives you that squeaky clean kinda feeling. In summers it is an excellent facewash for oily skin as it gives a nice matte look. It is quite drying, so u need to apply a moisturizer after it. See how clean my hand looks…

Yes it does make you white, but the effects are temporary. And I guess we all are intelligent enough as not to expect from a face wash to make us white or bright. It does its cleansing job well, and that’s what exactly needed.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Easily Available</li>
	<li>Lathers well (a little goes a looooooong way)</li>
	<li>Cleanse really well</li>
	<li>It does give you a whiter skin (though it is temporary)</li>
	<li>Good for all skin types.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What i did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>May seem expensive to some.</li>
	<li>Dry skin people may find it a bit drying (unlike dove facewashes, but I personally hate them coz they leave me feeling unclean and chikni chikni.)</li>
</ol>
<em><strong>Hope you all will give it a shot and let me know. See you soon</strong></em>
