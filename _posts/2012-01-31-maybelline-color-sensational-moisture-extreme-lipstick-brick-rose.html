<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you get the knack of lip shades, its hard to stop yourself from exploring the different shades out there. I am quite new to the world of Lip Color and still in experimental phase. As might have happened with almost each one of you, I started with natural, neutral and nude shades. But I was so inspired by you lovely ladies out there that I finally picked up my first red variant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2867.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2592" title="IMG_2867" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_2867.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<strong>Price:</strong> Rs 220

<strong>My experience:</strong> I picked this up since I did not want to plunge in with killer hot red shade instantly. Although I quite appreciate this lip stick for the prices it demands, it has smooth texture, great pigmentation and non drying.Â What I did not like the much is the slight tinge of golden shimmer in the color, but its not that much. Lasting power is kind of OK. On me this colors lasts around 3 hours and does not settle on fine lines.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Inclusion of slight golden shimmer,</li>
	<li>Packaging is quite cheap and I fear, it might break if not taken care of,</li>
	<li>Does not last long, and goes off with drinks, but I cant expect much at this price na :(</li>
