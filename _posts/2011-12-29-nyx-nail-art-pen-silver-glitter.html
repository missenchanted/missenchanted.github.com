Any nail art kit is incomplete without a pen and some shimmer, and when you combine the both you get NYX nail art pen in Glitter :)

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My experience:</strong> The quantity and quality is good for the price, but I would have liked it more if the glitter was fine, because for nail art you need precision and clean lines. Although the brush is lengthy and sturdy for a pen but the glitter is a bit chunky.</p>

Would love to try out other non glitter colors from this series as the brush and quantity is quite good.

Have you tried Nail art pen ?
