<p style="text-align: justify;">Rarely you will find a person who doesn't love lavender fragrance, its supposed to calm the senses and relieve stress. I love lavender because every product containing this comes in purple packaging.. silly na but I love purple :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_6740.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3655" title="IMG_6740" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_6740.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs.250 for 150gm</p>
<strong>About soap:</strong>
They say that opposites attract. This handmade bar of soap combines the bright, invigorating scent of lemons, oranges &amp; also the soothing notes of lavender to calm &amp; focus your mind. Together, these two lush scents create a unique &amp; powerful bar of soap that you wonâ€™t find anywhere else. Ground almonds exfoliate &amp; moisturizing cocoa butter leaves you with happier, healthier skin.
You're sure to love the thick, creamy lather of this soap so much, that you'll be back for more before you know it! This soap is suitable for normal to oily skin and lathers beautifully even in hard water.

<strong>Contains:</strong> Lavender, orange &amp; lemon essential oils, crushed almonds, cocoa butter, Vitamin E, glycerin, aqua, saponified oils of olive, coconut, castor, palm &amp; palm kernel.

<strong>My experience:</strong> This is a beautiful looking bar, like a piece of rainbow with three stripes. Lavender, cocoa butter and Almond can easily be identified just by looking. Smells like Lavender with very mild undertones of citrus, overall the fragrance is nothing powerful though. Almond section is supposed to be exfoliating, but if the soap is kept in moisture they tend to soften up (very obvious).
Overall I am quite pleased with soap, though I did not find it very calming but it lathers very well and gives a mild pleasant smell which is not long lasting. Does not dry up the skin, so need to rush for the moisturizer immediately.

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The pleasant lavender+mild citrus smell,</li>
	<li>Bar looks really cute and purple,</li>
	<li>Does not dry up the skin,</li>
	<li>Is exfoliating,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Keep away from moisture, as almond might soften up and there will be no ex-foliation (Soap does not melt)</li>
	<li>I did not find it calming(very difficult for me to access that)</li>
</ol>
Over all I am quite pleased with the soap, smells good, looks good, lathers well, exfoliates and does not dry up.
