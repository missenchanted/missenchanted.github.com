I was sitting at the hair studio(some 6-7 months back), when lady from Nail spa(Lakme studio earlier used to endorse Nail Spa Line) came upto me and asked if I would like to get some Nail Art. I was too embarrassed(I had this long habit of nail biting plus the brittle nails added to all my problems) and told her no I am not. When she insisted, I frankly told her "See maam, I have no nails, where do I get Art on ?". Thats when I was intoduced to the concept of Acrylic nail extensions.

She convinced me that this process has no side effects, and my natural nails will grow beneath the acrylic ones, which can be removed anytime I want.

And the end product was something like this

Price: Rs. 2000 for plain extensions and Rs. 2400 with permanent French(I went for the later)

Time taken: Around 1 hour

What I liked:
<ol>
	<li>The end product came out like a dream, I just could not stop adoring my hands :)</li>
	<li>I had these nails for like 20-25 days before getting them removed, and my nail biting habit was gone. Finally this did what my determination could not do in last decade or so :)</li>
	<li>I could apply any nail color and when I remove, I was back to the classic french ... it was adorable</li>
</ol>
<div>What I did not like:</div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Way to pricey, It can be done at home, just that you require a UV light to harden the coat.</li>
	<li>Have to handle with care, If it come out it might cause pain or nail breakage.</li>
	<li>If you want to keep it for more that three weeks, you will have to fill the nail ends with buffer again, that means some more money to be shelled out.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: left;">My Verdict: I would say, I had taken a good decision to get acrylic nails, it stopped my nail biting habit completely, plus I have long healthy nail that I am proud of.</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">My Nails now, without extension and a lot of determination</div>
