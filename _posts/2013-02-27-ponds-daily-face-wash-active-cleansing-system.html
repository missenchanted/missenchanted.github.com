<strong>My Experience with Ponds Daily Face Wash Active Cleansing System:</strong>

I did like the face wash, however this face wash contains SLS and paragons. Therefore, I will not be repurchasing it anymore.

It claims that it will not leave any slippery feeling behind but it does and I have to splash my face with water for like a hundred times to get this off. The packaging is nice and sturdy and the product is travel friendly due to the tight flip cap. The texture of the face wash is thick and slimy. A very small amount is needed and it foams perfectly.

If you are in a hurry then don’t even think of using this to clean your face because it take a long time to get off the face. Nevertheless, it does not dry out the face much and it has never broken me out. I have been using it for a few weeks and I like it as it cleans the skin properly. <em>I hope Ponds makes this face wash Paraben and SLS free.</em>
