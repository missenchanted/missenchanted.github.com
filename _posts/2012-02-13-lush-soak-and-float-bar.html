<p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to introduce my li'l sister on my blog here, I just took her interview for this product and wufff it went quite well. She has bad dry scalp and dandruff issues, which is just opposite to me. Strong and medicated shampoos leave her hair in a pretty bad state. I did some study on LUSH site and got her LUSH soak and float and did I tell you she is very happy with this product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2675" title="Untitled" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled.jpg" width="358" height="268" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 630</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LUSH says:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The scent of freshly made tar. </strong>Effective anti-dandruff shampoo bar that smells like rich tar. Cade oil gives Soak and Float its distinctive smell and works against the microbes which cause dandruff and it works to alleviate bothered scalps that are dry and itchy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lavender balances oil - and improves the scent! </strong>Lavender helps to condition poor, sensitive scalps and ever so slightly improves the smell!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cade Oil </strong>We use it in our Soak and Float solid shampoo bar for its antimicrobial effect. Soak and Float can help alleviate the symptoms associated with dry scalps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Water (Aqua), Cade Oil (Juniperus oxycedrus), Lavender Oil (Lavandula hybrida), Marigold Petals (Calendula officinalis), Rose Petals (Rosa centifolia), *Limonene, *Linalool, Perfume.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Completely natural and safe for hair,</li>
	<li>It actually cleans the scalp to a great extent without drying the hair and scalp,</li>
	<li>Gives a bit of shine, and moisture, but I still use a conditioner in the end,</li>
	<li>A small swipe is enough for one time. My first bar last me around 5 months (3 times a week)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Many will not enjoy its woody smell, not a personal favorite,</li>
	<li>It looks so ugly as you can make out from the above pic,</li>
	<li>Need to really take care, how I store it else melts like crazy,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn't remove the dandruff 100%, but surely I feel more clean as compared to other products.I have recently bought <strong>Snake Oil Hair Treatment</strong> bar and will review that soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Have you tried these LUSH products ?</strong></em></p>
