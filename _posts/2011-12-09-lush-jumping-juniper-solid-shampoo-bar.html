<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I start reviewing this solid shampoo from LUSH, I would like to mention my super oily scalp. Blotting paper soaks ample amount of oil from my scalp within 24 hours of hair wash, resulting in dull and limp hair and not to forget hair fall :(</p>
<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_2365.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1808" title="IMG_2365" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_2365.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a>If we use harsh shampoos that remove all oil from the hair, the scalpÂ  produces more oil in turn making hair oily very soon. Thus people with oily scalp should use balancing shampoos.

This is my fourth bar of the shampoo and I am totally addicted to it. Before using this I was washing my hair almost daily, but now I use it every alternate day.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs 540

<strong>Lush says:</strong> Lavender and juniper Shampoo Bar to control oily hair. Along with spots and exams, oily hair can be one of the most annoying things to torment your teenage years. Jumping Juniper cleans away grease and balances sebum production with lavender oil. Juniper sorts out an oily, congested scalp, while lemon and lime make your hair clean and shiny and give it an extra fresh scent. Juniper will get you jumping in no time.

<strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Best balancing shampoo I have ever used,</li>
	<li>One swipe is enough to lather shoulder length hair, so no wasting,</li>
	<li>Oily and limp hair get apt volume after wash,</li>
	<li>One bar lasts me 3-3.5 month easily with alternate day wash,</li>
	<li>Contains natural ingredients,</li>
	<li>Travel friendly, no more shampoo blasts,</li>
	<li>Might sound silly but I love the purple color,</li>
	<li>Leaves behind no smell, unlike many chemical based shampoos,</li>
	<li>If you buy 2 bars you get a tin container free worth Rs.75</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Makes the hair strands a bit dry, but that can be solved using a good conditioner,</li>
	<li>I store it away from water and humidity, on a china plate and not the tin container, else it gets all messy and wasted.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Will purchase again and again... its the shampoo for me. Even my hubby loves it :)
If you have oily scalp, you need to wash your hair very often due to dirt and grease do give this a try and you won't regret.</p>
Which is your favorite Shampoo ?
