<p style="text-align: justify;">Foundations are not a part of my daily routine. They come out of shelf only when I have to attend some late evening parties, rest times I just manage with my BB cream and a translucent powder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5414" title="MAC Face and Body Foundation 1" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-1.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></a>Main reason to avoid liquid foundation has to be the heavy feel they give on my skin. I also avoid mineral powder foundation too because they make me look like a disco ball in pictures, If I don't contour my face properly and contouring is something I don't try much.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5415" title="MAC Face and Body Foundation 2" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-2.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 1700 for 50ml</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shade:</strong> Comes in <em>two different series 'C' &amp; 'N'</em> depending on skin tone. I have this in <em><strong>N2</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5417" title="MAC Face and Body Foundation 4" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-4.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a><strong>Claim:</strong> A water-based, water-resistant foundation that provides long-lasting, natural coverage for face and/or body. Ideal for all skin types. Face and Body Foundation provides sheer, natural looking coverage in an easy to blend, water-resistant formula. The long-lasting formula is available in a wide range of colors and contains several emollients to help moisturize and condition the skin. It delivers professional looking results that meet the exacting standards of beauty photography and is ideal for perfecting the face and body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5416" title="MAC Face and Body Foundation 3" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-3.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>I had read about how beautifully this foundation photographs, and had no second thoughts about picking this over the MAC counter in Bangalore. I just can't believe this is a Limited edition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5418" title="MAC Face and Body Foundation 5" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-5.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>MAC face and body foundation has very runny texture and blends beautifully even with fingers. But I would suggest a stippling brush for better results. I prepare my skin with a balancing moisturizer before I move onto the foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5419" title="MAC Face and Body Foundation 6" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-6.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>It may look sheer and may not give heavy coverage in one layer, but don't use more product in one go. Apply a very thin layer, let it dry and then top it up with another thin layer for complete coverage. Gives a dewy finish and has to topped up with a translucent powder for an oily skin like mine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5420" title="MAC Face and Body Foundation 7" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MAC-Face-and-Body-Foundation-7.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>Its the most natural finish giving foundation that I have ever come across, feels very light on skin and photographs beautifully. But does it give coverage, yes it would but you need to layer it many times(2-3), which can be bit time consuming and effort taking. It has amazing stay power without making you looking dull and dark for like 14 hours(<em>tested and tried.. late Indian weddings..sigh</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Highly recommended</em> if you are tired of your bad pictures spoiled by whitish cast of the foundation, this is the most natural looking foundation ever. Give it a try and you wont regret :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Have you tried MAC Face and Body Foundation ?</strong></em></p>
