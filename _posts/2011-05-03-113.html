<p style="text-align: left;">Let Jonny go that way, you mind your own business else don't say I did not warn you. I picked up this book to get a taste of writing from young Indian writers, after a great read from Amish and Flipkart reviews. Its a racy read but has nothing to offer, completely inspired from bolywood drama which encapsulates "Jab bhagwan bajate hain to acche se" or "aasman se tapka khajur mein ataka".</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This could have been much better, had Karan thought about numerous loopholes in his story like how a MITian can be so dumb enough to end up in such situation, did they fly to Cambodia without a visa, no one else even told them about world class situations etc etc etc and etc. Honestly it felt like those dreams you get in morning after watching some action movies, illogical and dumb.</p>
