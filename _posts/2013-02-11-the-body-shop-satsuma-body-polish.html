<h4>The Body Shop Satsuma Body Polish</h4>
I visited The Body Shop Outlets last week, hoping I could pick up some winter limited editions, but everything was over, in almost every outlet out here in Bangalore. So I returned back with some of my all time favorites, few body polishes, shower gels and soaps...which means you might find The Body Shop reviews very frequently on the blog. Although I have used The Body Shop Satsuma Body polish earlier too, but could never cover this on the blog... so this post is dedicated to my favorite range(<em>Satsuma</em>) from The Body Shop

I have used this earlier also(<em>this is my 3rd purchase</em>), and had fallen in love with the citrus smell that lingers back on my skin and in the washroom too, making it smell like an orange garden. This is a mild scrub and I use it like a shower gel/cream with loofah. It lathers really well and leaves back squeaky clean and fragrant skin. This does not dry the skin, but you still need a good body butter after bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-Body-Shop-Satsuma-Body-Polish-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6261" title="The Body Shop Satsuma Body Polish 3" alt="The Body Shop Satsuma Body polish" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-Body-Shop-Satsuma-Body-Polish-3.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>One tube with daily usage will last 2-2.5 months, so its quite economical too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You should definitely give The Body Shop Satsuma Body Polish a try if you like fresh and citrus fragrance, I mean natural orange fragrance and something that lingers back on your skin for hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are looking out just for exfoliation and need a really good body scrub than give this a skip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Body Shop Satsuma Body polish, is on my <em><strong>permanent skin care list</strong></em> and I am going to buy this forever.</p>
