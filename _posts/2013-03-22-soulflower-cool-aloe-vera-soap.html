<strong>My Experience:</strong> The soap is a vibrant green color, but I don't have much to say about this soap since none of its claims actually worked for me.

Its a green soap, with the mild smell of detergent. I had to sniff it so many times, before coming to the conclusion that it smells like detergent. But the smell is very mild and wont bother much.

This soap dries out my skin, and I need a nice oil massage or a heavy moisturizer in not so dry weather of Bangalore.

I can't say much about acne or Psoriasis, as they might need longer duration usage of the soap to see any visible difference. I would have continued so also if only this soap was slight moisturizing.

I wont suggest this soap to anyone, you can totally skip this and checkout some other really nice and fragrant soaps from Soulflower.
