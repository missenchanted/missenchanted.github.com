<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't believe in whitening creams, I put my faith in is healthy, and beautifully toned skin. I have acne prone skin which does leave me with seldom marks, I am sure you know how that feels :(</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been using Pond's white beauty for last one month and am quite impressed, it did give noticeable difference in 7 days. <em><strong>Ok nothing like whitening</strong></em> but definitely a <em><strong>better skin texture</strong></em>, slightly <em><strong>faded marks</strong></em> and thats quite a lot for <em><strong>one week</strong></em>.</p>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 249 for 50gm
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My Experience:</strong> This has become my HG day cream, gives me matte skin and controls oil. It has given me back this beautiful skin texture which I am in love with. This cream needs to be blended properly and very fast, else it might not get absorbed and you might need slight water/rose water and blend again.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ponds has changed their packaging... they are heavy on your purse now.... I mean that by weight :P, Seriously the lid is quite heavy and difficult to carry around.</p>

<strong>What I like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Feels very light and gets absorbed within seconds,</li>
	<li>Comes with SPF 20,</li>
	<li>Definitely evens out the skin tone and slowly fades away mark,</li>
	<li>Did not break me out, (I have oily and acne prone skin),</li>
	<li>Gives a matte finish, works as good makeup base,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I believe it will suit only Normal-Combination skin only,</li>
	<li>The lid is really heavy to carry in your bag.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will <em><strong>t</strong><strong>otally recommend</strong></em> this to beauties with <em><strong>Oily or combination skin</strong></em>, and believe me you will just love it. It helps with <em><strong>even skin tone</strong></em>, <em><strong>fades marks</strong></em>, <em><strong>oil control</strong></em> and <em><strong>sun protection</strong></em>.</p>
<em><strong>Now I am tempted to try out their night cream too...any suggestions?</strong></em>

<em><strong>*Product was sent by the company, but that has not affected the review.</strong></em>
