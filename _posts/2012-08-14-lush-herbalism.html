<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been juggling between extreme pressure at work and my dream house(more of nightmare), running around the city to select hardware, test painting sample and just not able to accommodate my activities. I need a break and finally it is here.. Goa here I come...Sorry guys for MIA....</p>
More about Herbalism :P

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 585 for 100gm

<strong>Claims:</strong> A powerful decongestant for your pores, Herbalism is best suited to those who have tried everything under the sun to clear up their oily and blemish prone skin. Fear not! Herbalism’s heroic blend of rosemary, nettle and chamomile are here to tame problematic skin. Ground rice bran acts as an effective exfoliant, while kaolin (also known as China clay) reaches deep down into pores to clean out dirt and debris. Use this cleanser in combination with Grease Lightning for balanced, even skin.

<strong>My experience:</strong> This cleanser is a green clay paste, which is more on the granular side, you can feel the soft small chunks of almond. Strangely it neither smells Almond nor any of its ingredients like rosemary, rather it smells very creamy and milk type.
I take a small pea size cleanser and make a paste, apply it on my face, leave it on for 5 min, splash a little water and use circular motion to rub it off. Since the almond are quite chunky, they keep falling off and can be a bit of a mess. It behaves very similar to milk masks that I prepare at home, because when I splash water, I can see small drop of water on my face like  it still has some coat of oil/moisture. I avoid using any cream after this.
This is not meant for Oil control for sure, and neither can it remove makeup. You have to remove all traces of makeup before using it.
It gives me an instant glow, and brighter skin. Although the results are just temporary. For me this a triple purpose product Cleanser + Scrub + Mask.
I can see a slight improvement in skin tone, you have to use it for long to see better results.

<strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Its completely natural and safe,</li>
	<li>Gives an instant temporary glow,</li>
	<li>Did not break me out,</li>
	<li>Does not dry the skin and does not feel stretchy,</li>
	<li>Works as Cleanser + Scrub + Mask</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I did not like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Although its meant for Oily skin, but does not control oil,</li>
	<li>Cleanser shelf life is 3 weeks,</li>
	<li>Cannot remove makeup,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall its a great product, people who are looking for natural and soothing cleanser should definitely try this. You have to be committed to your skin, else just using this product won't work wonders.</p>
<strong>Home made cleanser for similar results:</strong> Grind Masoor Dal(Red lentils), take a small portion and mix it with milk and apply as a pack for 10-15 min then scrub it off slowly. It will definitely remove tan and work on those blemishes.. promise :)
