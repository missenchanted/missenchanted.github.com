<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently finished my DOL Compact and was planning to switch back to my old favorite Lakme Radiance, and I received this Tips &amp; Toes Mineral Compact in my courier. As an oily a compact is a permanent item on my list 365 X 24 X 7 except when I am sleeping..</p>
<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7343.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4971" title="IMG_7343" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7343.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 350 for 6gm

<p style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly this shade does suit my skin and does soak the oil for sometime. The packaging is sturdy and comes with good quality sponge(<em>much better than many buffs/sponges in the market</em>), which provides easy application, an inbuilt mirror which makes it a contender for your purse. It did not break me out, neither did it feel heavy on the skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Product also claims that we can't use the compact with wet sponge to get more flawless look. But I consider using the compact the way it should be use. Although secretly I did try using it once... not bad I would say. Results are almost same as using it dry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But but but ... this keep my oily skin matte only for like 2-3 hours and this is where it disappoints me the most. Maybe it will fare better on dry to normal skin. But it does fare much better when I use it over the BB cream or the foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7344.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4972" title="IMG_7344" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7344.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7345.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4973" title="IMG_7345" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7345.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comes in 4 shades which makes me doubt if that will suite all Indian skin tones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wish Tips &amp; Toes pay more detailed attention to their packaging, for most of the times we do judge a book by its cover. The packaging feels cheap for this quality and price, and should learn from Lakme &amp; Maybelline how they package their stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Shade I have here is Sea Coral</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7346.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4974" title="IMG_7346" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7346.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall its an average compact and it does not keep me oil free, but then presence of a good quality sponge and a mirror definitely makes it a contender for your attention. Dry to Normal skin beauties can give this a try.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Which is your favorite Tips &amp; Toes product ? Mine has to be their nail color.</strong></em></p>
