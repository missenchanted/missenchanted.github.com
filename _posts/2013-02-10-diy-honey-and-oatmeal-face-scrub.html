<strong>DIY:</strong> Take about a quarter cup of plain oat meal, you can blend this with a hand belender or a mixer to get it to a powder form or go right ahead with the oat meal just as it is. A little granular that is. Mix this with about one spoon of honey and a little water as needed to get consistency.

I recommend leaving this mixture for about an hour so that the oatmeal absorbs the honey. If the oatmeal is in the granular form it will soften up. You can now massage this mixture into your skin, as you go about doing this make sure to use only the tips of your fingers and move in a circular pattern. Let your skin soak in the honey while the oatmeal works its way through dead skin, bacteria and black heads. Both these magical ingredients are known for their anti-inflammatory properties they also attack acne, blemishes and soothe suburns. Wash this off with cold water, and dab on a toner or rose water. It leaves your skin so soft, radiant and deeply cleansed and nourished.
