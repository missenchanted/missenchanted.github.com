<h4>Maybelline Colorsensational Lipstick My Mahogany</h4>
We all have our own favorite <strong>MLBB</strong>(<em>My Lips but better</em>) shade. Today I am going to review my favorite nude lipstick Maybelline Colorsensational Lipstick My Mahogany.

<strong>Price:</strong> 299/- (<em>their prices have hiked now</em>)

<strong>What is a nude lipstick?</strong>

<em>Nude lipstick</em> is just like foundation, you have to find the right one for yourself. If chosen properly, it can make you look glamorous. A nude lipstick is a lipstick that comes to the rescue whenever you are in dilemma. It’s a lip color that doesn’t make you stand out, but stands with you as if your own color. . Nude lips are great to go with dark eye makeup.
<blockquote>Girl with fair skin and pink undertones should opt for <em>pinkish brown lipsticks</em>.

Those with fair skin and olive and yellow undertones should opt for <em>Peach mixed brown shade.</em>

Dark skin girls should go for <em>bronze and brownish lipstick.</em></blockquote>

You should always lookout for some peachy, pinkish, or bronze touch in the beige color of your nude lipstick. Pure beige may make you look like a ghost. If you have very pigmented lips, then instead of going for darker and more dark shades, you should <em>neutralize the pigmentation of your lips with a concealer</em>. And then put on a right nude according to your skin tone.

<strong>Packaging:</strong> This is my most loved lipstick in terms of packaging. Maybelline has given a long cap which shows the color family to which the lipstick belongs. This one has brown translucent cap with a shining silver base.

<strong>Smell:</strong> It smells great.  Even if you’ve opened the cap and still thinking whether to put on the lipstick or not, the smell will make you apply it. It is really very pleasant.

<strong>Texture:</strong> It is a nice creamy moisturizing lipstick. You don’t need to apply a lip balm underneath. People with dry lips should exfoliate/moisturize and then apply

<strong>Shade:</strong> This can be a perfect nude for fair skin girls. On dusky beauties it may pop out. This is a peach brownish color with no shimmer in it. It makes my face look so soft and delicate.

<strong>Staying power:</strong> The only con with this lipstick is the staying power. It stays not more than 2-3 hours. But if you have no problem with touchups like me, then go for it.

This is my kind of <em>Holy grail</em> lipstick, I pick up this shade whenever I am in doubt. It lets me play subtle and sober.
