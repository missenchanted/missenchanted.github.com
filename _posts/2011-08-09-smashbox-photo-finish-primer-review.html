<strong>Santhoshi</strong> is on a roll, here is another great product from her makeup box :)

<!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->Hey All,

Here is the picture of the cult favorite Smashbox line: The photo finish primer.   It has won the following awards:
<ol>
	<li>Winner of Best of Sephora Award for Best Primer,</li>
	<li>One of Marie Claire’s “25 Products That Will Change Your Life,” and</li>
	<li>An InStyle Best Beauty Buy.</li>
</ol>
<!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } --><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303" title="1" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/11.jpg" alt="" width="912" height="610" /></a>

In my honest opinion,  I feel this is a keeper . However, I have used it only on rare occasions (wedding or parties) for myself as well as the bride-to-be  as its freaking  expensive  and cant afford to waste the product .  This is a beauty must-have for a photo-ready face .  This can be purchased at <a href="http://inen.strawberrynet.com/product-search/?searchLineId=&amp;searchField=Smashbox+photo+finish+primer">strawberrynet</a>.

The product itself is the texture of a thick gel ,  it gives a velvety feel when rubbed between the palms.  It gives a smooth canvas for applying foundation or powder.  The makeup never slides or disintegrates even in hot humid Indian weather and gives a right amount of glow-from-within look.

I have heard that the NYX Studio Perfect Primer is a close dupe for this, however I have not tried it personally.

<strong>Has anyone tried Smashbox or NYX Studio perfect primer ?</strong>
