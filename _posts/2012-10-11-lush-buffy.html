Scrubbing always takes a back seat when I am rushing to office, but not anymore.. I have Lush buffy with me and its one of the most effect body scrub and body butter ever.

I have never mentioned before on the blog that I suffer from Keratosis pilaris(red bumps on forearms), which can be a real embarrassment sometimes and I mostly refrain from flaunting my arms. Only solution to KP is lots of exfoliation and heavy moisturizer but who has that much time, and little efforts don't count here. I am sure people with KP will relate to me here. This product was made for me, a gift for my dry skin. It was love at first sniff...

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its a superb body scrub and a moisture bomb. After shower I step away from water and use it like a regular soap in circular motion. Initially it might feel a bit gritty, but gradually it smoothens out and is not harsh, but avoid using on thin skin like face, neck etc. then wash of with warm water. I use it daily, without a miss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its amazingly moisturizing, and I don't need any kind of moisturizer after this, skin stays soft and moisturized for more than 24 hours even for a dry skin like mine. Its a slayer for dead skin and bumps leaving behind smooth, soft and supple skin for hours. I could see change in the texture of my skin in 3-4 days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No more KP bumps but the old red marks are still there (<em>Fingers crossed.. they will be gone soon</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been almost 2 weeks since I started using this, but I still have more than 3/4th of the product left.</p>

Even though its a bit steeply priced, but totally worth and has found a permanent place in my shelf..

I will totally recommend this to everyone who has dry skin, and specially to those who have red bumps, KP and require a thoroughly pampered and moisturized skin. Oily skin can give this a skip..
