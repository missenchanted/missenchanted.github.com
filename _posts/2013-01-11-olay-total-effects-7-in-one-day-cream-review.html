<p style="text-align: justify;">Key to healthy and glowing skin is cleansing, scrubbing, moisturizing, moisturizing and moisturizing again. The problem of people with oily skin like mine is that we are afraid of trying new cream/moisturizer for our face, as we never know what may break us out. Many people even skip the moisturizer at night, since the skin self produces oil at night and thats wrong.</p>

You just need to identify the right cream for you. I have tried many  moisturizers and Olay Total effects 7 in one day cream struck with all the right cords
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 350 for 20gm</p>

<em>Line minimization</em>: Reduces the appearance of fine wrinkles.

<em>Subtle lifting</em>: Hydrates for firmer skin appearance.
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Olay-Total-effects-day-cream-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5464" title="Olay Total effects day cream 3" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Olay-Total-effects-day-cream-3.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>I can't much say about the line minimization and subtle lifting claims. But tone enhancement and moisturization, I could myself see the results in 8-10 days. My friend whom I suggested this, was also all praises how it minimized her large pores and now they look more refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to add here, that if you do not have even tone then baby just moisturize and pamper your skin ,and drink liters and liters of water. You will see the difference yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Olay-Total-effects-day-cream-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5465" title="Olay Total effects day cream 4" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Olay-Total-effects-day-cream-4.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>A pea size dollop is enough for one application, does not look greasy and instantly gets absorbed in the skin, giving a perfect base for makeup. I did not find any drawbacks with cream, just that I cannot say much about the wrinkle and line minimization.</p>
