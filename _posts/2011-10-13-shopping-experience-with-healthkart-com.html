I have completely turned into a online shopper unless the product requires swatch consideration, plus my last one month's schedule did not allow me to go out :(

Currently there has been a surge in Indian online market as many websites are providing quality and reliable services with DISCOUNTS... what do I need more ???

<strong>My Experience:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Delivery was fast using DTDC,</li>
	<li>Free shipping but above orders worth Rs.500</li>
	<li>Cash on delivery - Love that</li>
</ol>
<strong>My Suggestions</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I hope they stock up the Brands they currently have e.g. Aroma magic etc</li>
</ol>
I am really happy just received my package today :) Whats your experience with healthkart.com ?
