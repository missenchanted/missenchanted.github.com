<h4>Faces Go Chic Lip Gloss Sheer Coral</h4>
Coral is such a beautiful shade that no one can resist. I can't even imagine what would happen to the color pallete if Peach and Coral were to be removed. During my last visit to Faces cosmetics counter, my eyes stopped at this beautiful coral tube, and just wont budge. I swatched the gloss, although it did not impress me much but I still picked it up for the tube was just so beautiful and I knew I will somehow make Faces Go Chic Lip Gloss Sheer Coral work for myself,

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.199 for 7.5 ml.

<strong>Packaging:</strong> Faces cosmetics has recently changed the packaging from the square tube to round tube, but has kept the dove foot applicator same. I totally like the new packaging over the previous one.

<strong>Shade:</strong> In the tube, it might give an impression of intense coral, but in actual its a very sheer gloss and wont even show up coral tint on pigmented lips.

<strong>Texture:</strong> Its a little sticky, and keeps the lips moisturized

<strong>Staying power:</strong> Maximum 2 hours with only drinks in between. Need reapplication very often.

<strong>Fragrance:</strong> Its very fruity and candy type. Maybe a bit too much for sensitive nose. I personally don't like the smell but it fades aways quickly.

So my hunt for a Coral gloss is still on, overall Faces Go Chic lipgloss is quite an average budget product. People on a budget can give it a try. I might pick up another shade from the range if it tempts me, else will give them a pass.
