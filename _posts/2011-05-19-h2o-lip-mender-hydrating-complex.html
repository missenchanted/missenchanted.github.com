Price: Rs. 325 for 15ml

Product boasts of : A conditioning lip balm formulated with hydrating marine algae and vitamin E to sooth away the appearance of fine lines while protecting against dehydration. Infused with herbal mint essence.

Product contains: Microcrystalline wax, Bees-wax (Cera Alba), Phenyl Trimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Flavour (Aroma), Tocopheryl Acetate, Extracts of: Algae, Ulva Lactuca, Crithmum Maritimum, Methylparaben, propylparaben, Isopropyl Myristate, Limonene.

Have been using this tube for last 2-3 months, quite good and work well on chapped and dry lips. Totally colorless and as a mild minty and soothing fragrance. Although they contain paraben, after researching on net I found that Methylparaben and propylparaben are considered safe (GRAS) for food and cosmetic antibacterial preservation. Studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UV rays leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage.

What I Like:
<ol>
	<li>The minty fragrance,</li>
	<li>It heals dry and chapped lips,</li>
	<li>Hygienic packing,</li>
</ol>
What I don't like:
<ol>
	<li>Quite expensive when compared to other excellent balms,</li>
	<li>Inclusion of paraben,</li>
</ol>
My Verdict: It's quite expensive as a balm, as there are some other great products for much lesser price :)
