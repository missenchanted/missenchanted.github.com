I just got my hands on my first Magnetic nail paint from MUA, and I have fallen in love with Nail colors all over again. Its like I have found something really new and exciting.

I happen to pick up this magnetic nail paint during recent MUA sale, and regret that I did not pick up the entire range.

<strong>Price:</strong> £3.50 (Rs. 300)

<strong>How to apply:</strong> Just apply the magnetic glitter to your nail, and while the polish is still wet, hover the magnetic brush cap over your nail for five seconds. Be careful not to touch the polish, though! Because when you remove the cap, a unique design will appear!

Its a beautiful shade and my nails feel and look good, its a mettalic shade with a depth. Dries up in  like 4 to 5 min completely which is really good and no chipping for like 6-7 days thats double awesome.

I would blindly suggest these nail paints to anyone and everyone and even if you are not into nail paints.. just pick it up for the sake of fun and I am sure you would love it.

I picked up few other pastel shades from MUA, but dont want this one to be off my nail... I am hooked to it.... believe me.
