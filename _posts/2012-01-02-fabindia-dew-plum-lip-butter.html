How many times has this happened with you, you were almost at the billing counter and you picked up some stuff just because it looked cute, or maybe adding one more item gave you more satisfaction.. ha ha that's me. I picked this up on a total whim, anyways I don't think much when it comes to lip balms.

<ol>
	<li>Quite economical for the quantity,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The consistency is very dense or to say thick. During winters you cant take out a respectable amount using your finger :(</li>
	<li>Not enough moisturizing,</li>
	<li>Have to reapply very frequently,</li>
	<li>It has a weird fragrance.. quite waxy kind and I don't like it :(</li>
	<li>Doesn't melt like other lip balm on the lips gives that whitish cast if applied more :(</li>
	<li>Contains parabens to add to all the woos</li>
	<li>Tub packaging is another negative point</li>
</ol>
I dont know <em>"what part is dew here and what part is plum"</em>. I am totally disappointed from this product. It does nothing for the lips. I used this as cuticle cream for my toes and fingers at night only :)

Not gonna buy this again. How about you ?
