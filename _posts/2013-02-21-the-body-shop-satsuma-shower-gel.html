<h4>The Body Shop Satsuma shower gel</h4>
<em>Close your eyes and feel standing in an orange orchard with pure fragrance and sunlight</em> ...Nope you did not feel that... its because have not met the Satsuma range from The Body Shop. Its my favorite shower gel of all times and even though I keep on trying new brands, but I always have one bottle of The Body Shop Satsuma shower gel with me.

Comes in a standard The body shop packaging in a see through bottle and a flip cap. The gel seems like sun light captured in a limited space. Its orangish golden.. if I could describe that way. It has a zesty yet sweet orange smell, which does not seem artificial. Lathers beautifully and leaves back squeaky clean skin. The fragrance lingers back on the skin and the washroom too. Sometimes I come back from office after hours and my washroom still smells like orange.

Few drops are enough to lather nicely, so one bottle would easily last around 3 months.

I have nothing negative to talk about this product and just love it to bits. This is a highly recommended product, and everyone should at least take a sniff at the TBS counter and I am pretty sure you will end end up bringing this beauty home.
