<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6059.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3005" title="IMG_6059" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6059.jpg" width="333" height="500" /></a><strong>My Experience:</strong> The moment I opened this scrub, I was in heaven. I am a very lazy person and I feel so tired and sleepy to get ready for the office. This scrub actually made me feel fresh and lifted my energy. Since I have oily skin, I avoid anything made out of chocolate or coffee for face, but this one did not break me out, and gave a clean and fresh feel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6065.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3006" title="IMG_6065" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_6065-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What I like:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Smell... the coffee, smells so fresh, a slight hint of chocolate too,</li>
	<li>Did not break me out, and did not dry the skin,</li>
	<li>Gave a clean and fresh feel</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Price, definitely on a higher side, but that when discounts come in handy... check <a href="http://missenchanted.com/great-discounts-during-happy-hours-at-the-natures-co/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a></li>
	<li>Not that easily available in non metro cities,</li>
</ol>
You can check Tanveer's recipe for Coffee scrub <span style="color: #000080;"><a href="http://addictedtoblush.blogspot.in/2011/07/home-made-coffee-body-scrub.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000080;">here</span></a></span>, which I would totally recommend to everyone to give a try at least once.

Do check this out if you feel lazy enough to make it at home, if you get a discount, if you love coffee, or you want to wake up those sleepy eye of yours in the morning.
