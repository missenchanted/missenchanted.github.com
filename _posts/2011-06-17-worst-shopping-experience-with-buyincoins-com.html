I wanted to buy an eye pallet for a quite sometime, after reading some reviews on net I finally placed my order @ <strong>buyincoin.com</strong> on 03 June, 2011, and I received my order on 16 June, 2011. I had ordered

It was a <strong>nightmare</strong>, when I got the parcel. I had to go to a local post office along with an ID card to collect the parcel :(

Excited and curious, I opened the Grey packet, i could see color on the bubble wrap, but I din worry as I had read 2-3 eyeshadow might get damaged. But when I opened the pallete, I knew my <strong>money has gone down the drain. </strong>
<ol>
	<li>Mirror is into pieces</li>
	<li>25-30 eyeshadow are damaged</li>
	<li>Renaming ones I cant use , mirror shads :(</li>
	<li>And nail corrector is all dry, not even working</li>
</ol>

I dropped in few mails to them with product pictures but, no reply in last 24 hours. If I get no reply only alternative I have is throw all of it in dustbin.

I am having the worst shopping month ever, first <a title="LUSH cheating" href="http://missenchanted.com/cheated-by-lush-dont-forget-to-check-expiry-date-before-you-buy/" target="_blank">LUSH cheating</a>, now this parcel...

<strong>Whats your experience with Buyincoins ?</strong>

<strong>[important]</strong>I got a response back from buyincoins, they apolozised for the bad delivery and offered a full refund or redelivery if I return the product to China OR they will give a refund of 4$. Although their packaging was not effective enough but they did put a fragile sticker, still I got a completely broken product.<strong>[/important]
