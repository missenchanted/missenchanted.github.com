<p style="text-align: justify;">Good Morning.. and say hello to the winters, I just opened my window and see the whole city covered in fog. It no doubt looks beautiful but compels me to move myself back into the blanket and yes can someone give me a cup of tea. Dreams I say.......</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had bought Maybelline Lip Smooth Color Bloom in Peach blossom quite some time back, but then stopped using it. My stick kept on breaking with every usage(<em>what a waste of product</em>) and I have this habit of using balm every 2-3 hour and it made my lips look so bright fuchsia pink.</p>
<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7323.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5070" title="IMG_7323" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7323.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybelline Claims that this lip balm will change color on application and give a peachy tint on your lips, whilst keeping it moisturized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 99 for  1.7gm</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The balm is off white in color and gives a pink tint with one swipe, with reapplications my lips start flaunting a fuchsia pink, so according to me Peach Blossom shade is a misnomer.</p>
<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7324.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5068" title="IMG_7324" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7324.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

I am not quite happy with the moisturizing power. Although its moisturizing when compared to lip colors but totally fails in front its counterparts such as <a href="http://missenchanted.com/maybelline-baby-lips-lipbalm-coral-flush/" target="_blank">Maybelline Baby Lips</a> or <a href="http://missenchanted.com/maybelline-smooth-lip-color-and-care-dolly-rose/" target="_blank">Maybelline Smooth Lip Color and care</a>

<span style="color: #000000;">Good news the color does not settle into fine lines even after re application and has SPF16. It has a very very mild fragrance too.</span>

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7325.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5069" title="IMG_7325" alt="" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7325.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></a>

So its a catch if you are looking for a pink tint lip balm just go on and grab this one, but for chapped and dry lips its a big no no.

I would rather buy <em><a href="http://missenchanted.com/maybelline-smooth-lip-color-and-care-dolly-rose/" target="_blank">Maybelline smooth Lip Color and care</a></em> anytime over this.

<em><strong>Which is your favorite tinted Lip Balm ?</strong></em>
