<p style="text-align: justify;">Any product that claims to have calming fragrance always attracts me, after a tiring day of complains and issues nothing can be better than treating yourself with some scented and calming bath. That's what inspired me to pick up this product... and yeah the 15% off tag too..<em>:greedy:</em></p>

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs.375 approximately..don't remember

<strong><!--more--></strong>

<strong>My experience:</strong> The Body shop Aqua Lily Gel Douche looks pretty through a see through bottle, but isn't that impressive when it comes to stand for its claims. Very mild lily fragrance, which is quite weird and not very much like lily for me. Since I had heard good reviews about it, I am finding it quite strange that the bottle lacks fragrance completely.

In other aspects, it lathers quite well so one bottle would last really long.

Me not buying again, since neither I found its fragrance enjoyable, nor did any scent stay on the skin or at least in the washroom. Nope nothing at all.
But If you like lilly, sniff it at the store before buying...<em>sniff sniff</em>
