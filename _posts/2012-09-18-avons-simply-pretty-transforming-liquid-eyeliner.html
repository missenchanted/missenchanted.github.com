Inglot's duraline had been resting on my shopping list for ages, I missed the online sale last year and has been waiting for it so long now :greedy me:, so when I saw this newly launched product in current catalogue I just got it.

<strong>Price:</strong> Rs. 219 for 3ml (This months launch offer Rs.149)

<strong>Claims:</strong> Have multiple colors at your fingertips. A magic liquid liner that transforms your favorite eyeshadow into a eyeliner so you can change your color like you change your mood

<strong>My experiments:</strong>

Dries up very quickly, 10 sec approximately. Almost smudge proof

Not waterproof, I just splashed some water and rubbed the lines

My attempt is not very clean, since I used the lousy buyincoins eye pallet, which is of no use believe me, its just meant for all sorts of experiments. I tried it with the Lakme Quad and it came out pretty sleek and clean. Dries up almost instantly and is smudge proof, but not exactly waterproof (It can survive water test unless you don't rub your eyes).

The felt tip is better than a brush applicator, but they should provide some alternative tips.

Is this an eyeliner alternative ?? nope definitely not, since its in such limited quantity, but yes you have all colors at your command just at the stroke of a brush. Nope I did not even dare try it on my waterline..never ever, so no waterline test.

I wont say its pretty cheap, beacuse if you calculate Inglot's duraline for 3ml that will turn out yet cheaper. And so Inglot duraline is still on my list and will do a comparison soon. Oh yeah you have a similar product from Faces cosmetics too.

<em><strong>So are you going to give this magic eyeliner a try ?</strong></em>
