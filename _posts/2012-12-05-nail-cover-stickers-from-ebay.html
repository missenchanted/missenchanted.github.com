I wanted to try some nail stickers for quite long now, so I ordered one from ebay.Â I had ordered these like two months back, then kept on waiting.. and then forgot about them. It felt like a surprise in my mail box.

<strong>Price:</strong> 1$

These are not like regular paper stickers, rather very thin and rubber like. I almost spoilt the first one while taking out. They did not turn out the way I hoped. Width is just too less for my nails, or I have much wider nails.. could be either way.

But these have to be the perfect arrangement for a quickie nail art. How many times does that happen that we don't even freshly paint our nails before a party, just because there is no time to perfectly dry them. This comes to rescue then.

I am going to pick a few more nail stickers for sure... but this time no more glitter.. makes me look like a teen.
