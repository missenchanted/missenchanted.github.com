I love lip balms... I know I have quoted this a zillion times :), but who doesn't like cute, colorful and great smelling stuff. I have picked up my first Maybelline tinted lip balm in Dolly rose and did I tell you, I am loving it.

This is a smooth lip balm, melts like butter on the lips, and comes in three different tinted variants. I am quite happy with the outcome, it moisturizes the lips, gives color and effective for dry and chapped lips(<em><strong>I Guess</strong></em>)

<ol>
	<li>Comes in 3 color variants, I took the most sheer shade,</li>
	<li>Smells good, nothing loud and differentiating,</li>
	<li>Melts like butter on lips(<em><strong>Amul ki kasam</strong></em>),</li>
	<li>Very moisturizing and will be good even for dry and chapped lips,</li>
	<li>Very economical and easily available,</li>
	<li>Sun protection, SPF16</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:(<em>Had to think really hard</em>)</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Average lasting time around 2 hours (<em><strong>I am OK with it though</strong></em>)</li>
</ol>
According to me its a really good product for this price, and I am definitely picking up other colors in this series.
