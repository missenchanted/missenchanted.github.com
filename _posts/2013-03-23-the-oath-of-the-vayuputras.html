<span>After a very long wait, The Oath of The <span>Vayuputras</span> was released in <span>Feburary</span> end. Shiva <span>triology</span> is undoubtedly a commendable piece of work from an Indian writer after a very long time.</span>

The First two books in the series, <a href="http://missenchanted.com/review-the-immortals-of-meluha/" target="_blank"><em><span>The Immortals of <span>Meluaha</span></span></em></a> and<a href="http://missenchanted.com/book-review-the-secret-of-the-nagas/" target="_blank"><em><span> The Secret of The <span>Nagas</span></span></em></a>Â were so well scripted and narrated that I fell in love with the character Shiva. I wont say that the final part is a perfect one, it has its own loopholes(<em>in my view</em>) but still the story is well presented.

What disappointed me a little was the end of the Trilogy and the long narrative war stories that turned my read a little boring.

Don't worry I am not going to spoil an excellent read for all of you, but I do have some serious questions in my mind and if by chance you have the answer to those do drop a comment. I am not able to get the answer to the following questions,
<ol>
	<li>Book mentions the rein of Ram that was before Krishna(a<em><span><span>nother</span> Vishnu avatar who is never mentioned in the story</span></em>). A refrence is made to <em><span><span>Bhagwad</span> <span>Gita</span></span></em> as the Book of Songs. <em><strong><span>Does that mean <span>Bhagwad</span> <span>Gita</span> <span>exsisted</span> before Krishna</span></strong></em> ?</li>
	<li><span>Lady Sati's apparition giving different advice to both her son, did sound a bit confusing. Did she really want to avenge or forgive ?</span></li>
</ol>
Since this book is a piece of <em><strong>fiction</strong></em> based on <em>mythology</em>, and most of the events in the past two books did relate somehow to my knowledge of Hindu religion. But the following again left me puzzled,
<ol>
	<li>The use of mass destruction weapon could not be related to mythology... Can it be ?</li>
</ol>
<span>The final two chapters were on a fast track. I had to stop and think why exactly <span>Brigu</span> changed his mind over someone's death. But then I was convinced with my own answer.</span>

<em>If you have read the first two books, this book is a must must read.</em>
<em>If you have <strong>not read</strong> any of the book, then all three books are a <strong>must must read</strong>.</em>

<em><strong><span>Going by Amish's word I guess next Trilogy is based on <span>Mahabharat</span>... Do you also think so ?</span></strong></em>
