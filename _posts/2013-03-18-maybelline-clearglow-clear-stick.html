<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Maybelline Clearglow Clear Stick</span>

With so many BB creams and tinted moisturizers in the market we are totally spoiled with the choices. Then came the Maybelline Clearglow Clear Stick, and before I could get my hands on them they have almost evaporated from every online shop and beauty shelf. I am an NC25 so Maybelline Clearglow Clear Stick Radiance would have been a perfect match for me.

Since I could not review this shade, as it made me look tanned and gave a bronze look, I requested a very dear friend to review this on my behalf. And this is what she had to say.

Packaging is a very light twist up tube, which is travel friendly. But the cap gets a bit messy if you are not very careful while closing it.

The texture is to fall in love for, it so soft and creamy. Just dab it on your face and then spread it using fingers. It blends beautifully. Gives an instant matte finish and the pores definitely look minimized. I use it to conceal my dark circles and it works perfectly.

Since I have oily skin, I am quite impressed with the matte finish, and this does not require any powder to top it up. The matte finish easily lasts me 3-4 hours outside  but then the T zone gets a bit oily and I need to set it again with some translucent powder. In AC the matte look lasts me longer for easily 6-7 hours,

Maybelline Clearglow Clear Stick feels like your own skin, flawless and radiant. Photographs really well.

<ol>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 13px;">Feels like your own skin, but flawless and radiant,</span></li>
	<li>Texture is soft and creamy, blends beautifully,</li>
	<li>Gives an instant matte finish, and the pores are almost hidden,</li>
	<li>Has SPF 21, which is an added bonus,</li>
	<li>Photographs really well,</li>
	<li>Decently priced,</li>
	<li>Covers dark circles and acne marks, coverage can be built on,</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I did not like:</strong>
<ol>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 13px;">Only two shades available, </span></li>
	<li>Cap can get a bit messy, if you are not careful</li>
	<li>As the claim says 12 hours of shine control, which I did not find true. But comparatively this does give a longer matte finish,</li>
</ol>
Overall I am quite impressed with Maybelline Clearglow Clear Stick, which such decent price tag this is a must buy for those, who prefer BB creams and tinted moisturizers for daily use. This will cover dark circles, acne marks and give a long lasting matte and radiant finish.

You can imagine how popular this is, I am unable to get one for myself its OUT OF STOCK everywhere.

Maybelline Clearglow Clear Stick is highly recommended purchase and I am sure you too will love it.
