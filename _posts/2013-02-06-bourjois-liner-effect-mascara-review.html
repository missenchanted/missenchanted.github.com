<h4><span><span>Bourjois</span> Liner Effect Mascara Review</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>I was at the <span>Bourjois</span> Counter with the intention of getting Glamour Max Definition Mascara, but that is always out of stock. I mean always and then I end up buying something else, but since I desperately needed good lengthening Mascara. I bought the <span>Bourjois</span> Liner Effect Mascara. There was no tester at the counter, but the SA opened a new tube and I couldn't resist but try it first. My lashes were longer and thick! And then I had to get this.</span></p>

<strong>Step 1:</strong> Use long bristles to stretch the mascara formula from root to tip. Intensely lengthens lashes without clumping.
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Use short bristles to deposit formula at the base of the lashes, emphasising roots for a liner effect. It will look as though you have used a pencil kohl in the inside rim of your lashes, without the hassle!

The mascara formula is enriched with kohl to intensify the result. For an intense glance that will surely be irresistible!

<strong><span>My Experience with <span>Bourjois</span> Liner Effect Mascara:</span></strong>
<span> The Formula is wet, which is what I dislike about Mascaras. I have used <span>Maybelline</span> always which is a dry formula and works wonder by adding volumes of density to your lashes. My lashes are moderately sparse, so I use two mascaras: <span>Volumizing</span> and lengthening at once. And this Mascara works wonder as Lengthening mascara. The Wand is unlike conventional mascaras, but is a slender brush with two halves divided into small and large rubber bristles. The smaller ones to wiggle from roots up to the ends which gives and ‘Liner’ effect, which I love.</span>

<a href="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bourjois-Liner-Effect-Mascara-Review-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6127" title="Bourjois Liner Effect Mascara Review 3" alt="Bourjois Liner Effect Mascara Review" src="http://missenchanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bourjois-Liner-Effect-Mascara-Review-3.jpg" width="900" height="675" /></a><span>The Mascara is pigmented too; I need to cleanse it twice to get rid of the darkness left behind. I use this Mascara for Day wear and definitely look decent with 2 coats. Thankfully it does not clump, with going slightly overboard. But then too many layers will definitely make lashes look fake. But if you have very thin and sparse lashes, you need <span>volumizing</span> mascara, since the bristles separates each lash, adding more length to each. I am happy with the results even when the price is pricking.</span>

<strong>What I liked:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>My lashes were Lengthy and Thick.</li>
	<li>Eyes indeed look like kohl rimmed, especially tight-lined.</li>
	<li>The Pigmentation is intense and adds depth to eyes.</li>
	<li>Brush is divided into two halves with small and large rubber bristles.</li>
	<li>This did not hurt or made my eyes watery, even when I have sensitive eyes.</li>
	<li>Availability is not an issue, it is available online too.</li>
	<li>Pretty packaging, Travel friendly as well.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What I disliked:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The wet formula takes too long to dry completely, which I am not used to.</li>
	<li>It is expensive, since Mascaras are to be discarded after 5-6 months, I don’t find it worth to spend so much on them.</li>
	<li>This may not suit Girls with very sparse lashes, with bristles separating each lash.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Verdict:</strong>
<span> This is a decent Lengthening Mascara and will work for moderately sparse lashes but will not create a magic for very sparse lashes. Dry Formula will work for them, and not wet that of <span>Bourjois</span>. It surely will turn out a worth buy, If you want a decent lengthening mascara.</span>

<strong>Will I buy again?</strong>  Yes, A Water proof version for Mascara.

<strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5
