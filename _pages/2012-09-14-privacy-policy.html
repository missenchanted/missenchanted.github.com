<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Missenchanted</strong></em> is a personal blog written and edited by me. All products mentioned and reviewed here have been bought by me, although sometimes I do receive samples for review and every such post mentioning those samples will have a disclosure at the end in bold letters. My opinion and reviews are completely honest and are not biased. Please keep in mind that although product reviews are completely honest, but what works on my skin, may not work for you.</p>
